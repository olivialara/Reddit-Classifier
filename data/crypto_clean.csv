the neccessity of it from their perspective everything is a potential threat to their power to their narrative a weed in their garden binance mandated full kyc today onlyfans just used the payment rails to threaten the livelihood of god knows how many people i'm consistently met with blank stares when people realize just how actually censurable they were and how caught in the blue they were by us financial regulations consistently people underestimate the capacity to censor payment rails this was one ideological group puritans not even the main one which i will not mention who is really obsessed with censoring peoples payment rails for wrongthink they have a new tool you may have just seen being implemented on bitmex deribit huobi and binance it's called veriscope it's a trustless decentralized way to comply with the travel rule well it is basically blockchain swift compliance is an nft if you don't have the layer 2 kyc token you get financially excluded pretty simple how long until every native wallet in the world gets blacklisted from depositing to full kyc exchanges that does not have this veriscope thing on it how long before they start blocking deposits that don't have a full custody chain history of wallets and vasps with travel rule compliant layer 2 kyc tokens we always knew this was coming whirlpool can't work on this nothing that lacks the kyc token can they're sneaking a gardened fungibility crisis onto us they're recreating swift and global financial exclusion they want to it's what they believe look i hate to say it folks but if you read the writing on the wall if we don't normalize venues and merchants in person accepting native bitcoin on native wallets in a cash like basis we run the risk of re excluding everyone cash is king because you can't do this to it that's why they want a cashless society if you want bitcoin to act like cash it's a cultural war more than anything i firmly believe issues with surveillance orwell antics concerning defi and lightning network in general are going to go strait to the supreme court they will fight us tooth and nail to the bitter end to have the right to use lightning network peer to peer payments en masse adoption at the point of payment like cash and if we lose that they will have constant surveillance over every payment and i see no outcome of that other than stranding a huge part of native bitcoin out of the us and eu gardened chain analysis surveillance ridden systems they want you to wake up a criminal sure there will be mass disobedience but ultimately with criminal banking secrecy act prosecution and irs enforcement on payment shops accepting 'unsurveilled lightning payments' they can ruin peoples lives businesses imprison people intimidate people much rather they would have a cbdc with an expiration date negative interest rate and immediate censorship making money on offshore exchanges and defi unlicensed products well don't be surprised if they have plans to keep it banned off offramps they dont' want you to make unsanctioned money that you can actually spend,censorship is the pot we're the frog,censorship is the pot we're the frogthe unfortunate battle we face is that people don't see what's coming they aren't equipped to understand what the law of the eu and us can do people underestimate the sheer technical capabilities and cunning of the state worse yet they fail to realize that these ideologues have a completely different world view for as much as you seek to avoid censorship they believe in the neccessity of it from their perspective everything is a potential threat to their power to their narrative a weed in their garden binance mandated full kyc today onlyfans just used the payment rails to threaten the livelihood of god knows how many people i'm consistently met with blank stares when people realize just how actually censurable they were and how caught in the blue they were by us financial regulations consistently people underestimate the capacity to censor payment rails this was one ideological group puritans not even the main one which i will not mention who is really obsessed with censoring peoples payment rails for wrongthink they have a new tool you may have just seen being implemented on bitmex deribit huobi and binance it's called veriscope it's a trustless decentralized way to comply with the travel rule well it is basically blockchain swift compliance is an nft if you don't have the layer 2 kyc token you get financially excluded pretty simple how long until every native wallet in the world gets blacklisted from depositing to full kyc exchanges that does not have this veriscope thing on it how long before they start blocking deposits that don't have a full custody chain history of wallets and vasps with travel rule compliant layer 2 kyc tokens we always knew this was coming whirlpool can't work on this nothing that lacks the kyc token can they're sneaking a gardened fungibility crisis onto us they're recreating swift and global financial exclusion they want to it's what they believe look i hate to say it folks but if you read the writing on the wall if we don't normalize venues and merchants in person accepting native bitcoin on native wallets in a cash like basis we run the risk of re excluding everyone cash is king because you can't do this to it that's why they want a cashless society if you want bitcoin to act like cash it's a cultural war more than anything i firmly believe issues with surveillance orwell antics concerning defi and lightning network in general are going to go strait to the supreme court they will fight us tooth and nail to the bitter end to have the right to use lightning network peer to peer payments en masse adoption at the point of payment like cash and if we lose that they will have constant surveillance over every payment and i see no outcome of that other than stranding a huge part of native bitcoin out of the us and eu gardened chain analysis surveillance ridden systems they want you to wake up a criminal sure there will be mass disobedience but ultimately with criminal banking secrecy act prosecution and irs enforcement on payment shops accepting 'unsurveilled lightning payments' they can ruin peoples lives businesses imprison people intimidate people much rather they would have a cbdc with an expiration date negative interest rate and immediate censorship making money on offshore exchanges and defi unlicensed products well don't be surprised if they have plans to keep it banned off offramps they dont' want you to make

fund is being established by the founder ceo of nzs largest crypto platform easycrypto the founder was working for nzs second largest bank as their corporate strategy manager when they registered easycrypto with the nz companies office nine months after establishing easycrypto the founder ceo moved to work in an executive strategic role for nzs national airline airnz where a former pm of nz and current chairman of the largest nz bank us majority shareholder owned is a board member the ex pm and chairman of nzs largest bank was very fond of the airnz ceo and nominated him to be the national parties next leader and so subsequently the ceo christopher luxon was elected to parliament and is biding his time to take leadership of the now opposition national party the national party is known for its close relationship with the us owned banks that dominate the nz banking sector anyway now this close associate of both of nzs largest banks not only operates the largest crypto platform but is also opening a investment vehicle designed to attract investors to bitcoin by holding the custody of the bitcoin in foreign funds this type of fund argues that many people don't want the trouble of holding their own bitcoin and dealing with the tax complications and so they will hold the bitcoin for you while charging an annual 2 5 fee they hope to do a deal with the nz government tax department allowing the fund members to be only taxed on an assumed and fixed rate of return of 5 instead of taxation on actual gains or losses although the nz ird does not appear to have yet agreed to this deal this looks like the commodification of bitcoin by bankers they offer the government a secure tax stream and themselves a secure income while the investors take all the risk but hold no real custody or control over the bitcoin such funds could be designed to move toward a scenario where bitcoin can only be held by such institutional custodians and not held directly by citizens this is of course a complete undermining and subversion of the entire bitcoin ethos and values the bankers cartel are afraid of bitcoin because its superior integrity is attracting more and more citizens to move their savings from fiat shitcoin to bitcoin integrity their corporate strategy managers are looking for all and every way they can capture and control and ultimately neuter bitcoin i hope they fail as enough of us are aware of their intentions and will never surrender our coins and hopes of change to their corrupt rentseeking custody,nz's first bitcoin only investment fund launched,nz's first bitcoin only investment fund launched https www stuff co nz business 126566058 nzs first bitcoinonly investment fund launched https www stuff co nz business 126566058 nzs first bitcoinonly investment fund launched this fund is being established by the founder ceo of nzs largest crypto platform easycrypto the founder was working for nzs second largest bank as their corporate strategy manager when they registered easycrypto with the nz companies office nine months after establishing easycrypto the founder ceo moved to work in an executive strategic role for nzs national airline airnz where a former pm of nz and current chairman of the largest nz bank us majority shareholder owned is a board member the ex pm and chairman of nzs largest bank was very fond of the airnz ceo and nominated him to be the national parties next leader and so subsequently the ceo christopher luxon was elected to parliament and is biding his time to take leadership of the now opposition national party the national party is known for its close relationship with the us owned banks that dominate the nz banking sector anyway now this close associate of both of nzs largest banks not only operates the largest crypto platform but is also opening a investment vehicle designed to attract investors to bitcoin by holding the custody of the bitcoin in foreign funds this type of fund argues that many people don't want the trouble of holding their own bitcoin and dealing with the tax complications and so they will hold the bitcoin for you while charging an annual 2 5 fee they hope to do a deal with the nz government tax department allowing the fund members to be only taxed on an assumed and fixed rate of return of 5 instead of taxation on actual gains or losses although the nz ird does not appear to have yet agreed to this deal this looks like the commodification of bitcoin by bankers they offer the government a secure tax stream and themselves a secure income while the investors take all the risk but hold no real custody or control over the bitcoin such funds could be designed to move toward a scenario where bitcoin can only be held by such

2020,1,1704,11,1715,,0,btc friends let s be honest bitcoin is confusing not to you you are on this r after all but to the people who have no idea what it is trying to explain bitcoin is even harder i m sure we ve all had those long complicated drawn out conversations which leave people more confused than when it started to aid its adoption we have to get better at explaining what bitcoin is here are a few tips that should hopefully help you manage a simple and easy to understand discussion about bitcoin before we get to that a few things to remember bitcoin is a fundamental change from what most people believe an explanation about bitcoin shouldn t be about being right or winning the argument instead it should be about helping someone explore a new idea and begin to understand that there are actually different alternatives to the only money they ve ever known bitcoin is complicated it s important to remember that this is as much of an emotion transformation for someone as it is a logical one a confused mind always says no if you leave a person confused or frustrated about what bitcoin is they are more likely to build up a resistance to it and become close minded because it s just too complicated adoption is a marathon not a sprint don t feel the need to word vomit all of your intense 1337 cypto knowledge in a single conversation slow and steady like a good story teller keep them wanting more now some tips to consider 1 start with what is bitcoin not why is bitcoin a fundamental mistake that people make is to try to justify why something exists before even explaining what something is your explanations need to act as a building blocks of knowledge which means you have to have a very clear very easily understood fundamental premise bitcoin is digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet an alternative form of money than what you are given by your local government that's it that's bitcoin while i m sure we can and probably will argue about what that base fundamental definition is it s important to start with what not why while hyperinflation store of value scarcity the federal reserve and how the printing of fiat devalues currency are all important it does not answer the question of what is bitcoin if you start with why you are skipping a major building block in the mind of the listener and are on your way to creating confusion and remember a confused mind always says no here is an example https www youtube com watch v w7l4a5dsyas now don t go full internet on me i m not degrading this person or this video thank you person for making this video this video is awesome i only bring it up because it is a recent video that got some attention it also demonstrates this point when asked to explain bitcoin here is the opening line the fed is out of control with printing money this is a why is bitcoin response already the listener is probably thinking what the heck does the fed have to do with anything i just wanted to know what bitcoin was and you may just lose your listener right there furthermore this video never actually says bitcoin is while there is an implied comparison to gold there is never a fundamental definition of what bitcoin is start with a clear concise definition of what bitcoin is before moving on to why bitcoin is 2 let them lead gauge their interest know when to stop when explaining any topic to someone who doesn t understand it there is a very strong temptation to tell everything you know this is human nature we are proud of what we know we want to display knowledge and proficiency we must however understand that it is counter productive to the learning process imagine that certain math teacher going over that certain math problem they explain it they are enthusiastic about it they write it on the chalkboard yet your eyes glaze over it s too much too fast you are just waiting until the end when they finally tell you the answer all logic and reasoning and understanding is gone this is similar instead of telling them everything you know let them ask allowing your listener to ask demonstrates two things an understanding of the last thing you said and more importantly interest ultimately that s what we want and need their interest believe me just like that little kid asking why why why they will give you every opportunity to share a little bit more and a little bit more for example bitcoiner bitcoin are digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet stop talking and leave space for them to ask noob oh ok well why do we need that what's wrong with the money i have now bitcoiner well there is a risk that over time the money that you keep in your wallet or bank account will actually be worth less and be able to buy less stuff stop talking and leave space for them to ask noob wait what do you mean and we are now on our way to a discussion about these messy and intense concepts of inflation vs deflation printing of fiat currency fractional reserve lending etc and through it all let them lead now this is the tough part if their eyes glaze over you have to stop when the questions stop you have to stop the last thing you want to do is ramble on once they ve stopped listening instead ask them a question i m sorry did you not understand something i said did i answer your question is this interesting to you by doing this you will give them an opportunity to ask you another question back up what did you mean when you said store of value or maybe even make a comment wow this stuff is pretty complicated in either case this actually helps keep the conversation going just back up explain it again keeping in mind your base concepts and definitions and see if you can talk them past where they got stuck maybe they shut you down entirely you know what this is crazy it can t be true let s change the subject to which the only correct response is ok we ll get to this later keep in mind that letting your listener lead will allow you to carry the conversation much further than you trying to push it along on your own 3 know your role a little at a time don t overcorrect so what s the end goal is it to have them whip out their phone download an exchange and make their first bitcoin purchase right then and there no of course not the role of these conversations is to leave them wanting more your goal should be to spark interest and curiosity if after talking with you they end up on the google or the youtube looking for more information then you ve done your part movies and tv condition us to want the big payoff at the end the parade the teary embrace the triumphant symphony that is not real life really the best ending to a bitcoin conversation might just be your listener making an audible but clearly deeply contemplative huh you ve done your job you ve got them noodling something they have never noodled before even once you understand bitcoin there is still an entirely different conversation about what the technology is how it works and how people interact with it and let s be honest it s complex and confusing exchanges blockchain forks difficulty adjustments miners cold storage more complicated ideas more jargon make sure you throttle yourself back and explain just a little at a time it s ok to have one conversation about the fundamentals of bitcoin and then an entirely different conversation about blockchain technology or how people acquire btc or the difference between storing bitcoin on an exchange versus a cold wallet don t fall into the trap of thinking you have to tackle all of this at once while all this is happening be careful not to overcorrect people know what they know right and what people know is always correct right be sensitive if your listener makes a comment that isn t true or is off track don t scold them or forcefully correct them if your listener feels attacked or threatened conflict will arise and once that happens their minds will be completely shut off no one listens during an argument don t attack explain for example noob well the usd is backed by gold so that will prevent it from ever devaluing bitcoiner you know it s pretty interesting a lot of people think the same thing the truth is that while the usd was backed by gold for a long period of time it isn t anymore you see back in 1971 keep it simple factual and non confrontational going back to our example from before even if your listener shuts you down entirely that s ok they have now experienced a bitcoin conversation that will percolate around in their brain and perhaps next time they hear the word bitcoin whether on the news or on the internet they ll think back to your conversation and what you shared with them hopefully you didn t over press and their memory of your conversation isn't a negative one which leaves them feeling negative about bitcoin bitcoin is stupid and people who believe in bitcoin are arrogant and rude finally encourage them to do their own research the journey doesn t start and end with you you are simply a stepping stone along their path know that you are playing a part in their story you are not the main character adoption of bitcoin will occur over a long period of time the conversations we have with our friends and family will create the buzz attention and understanding that is needed but please be mindful that you are doing it in a helpful and productive way that leaves people wanting to know more oh and step 4 stack sats and

2020,1,451,8,458,,0,for the last few years i loved both gold and bitcoin although i had much more of my net worth in gold after much thought i've decided i will be soon liquidating my gold and buying more bitcoin here's why i believe after this whole covid shitshow is said and done fiat currencies are going to be fucked and all governments are going to realize that they must back their currency by some sort of reserve asset we really only have 3 options gold silver oil and bitcoin let's just disregard oil because we all know oil is slowly on it's way out with the way china is hoarding gold i believe china will back it's new central bank digital currency by gold reserves the whole world will start rethinking using the us dollar backed by nothing you can say army but that's not going to work for long the us isn't going to copy china and back their currency by gold again imo so i honestly think they'll choose bitcoin although i could easily be wrong anyways both gold and bitcoin are a good bet against fiat currencies the only problem is that when gold prices go up demand goes up a shitload more miners start mining gold and the price of gold eventually comes back down to it's cost of production and usually overshoots it to the downside due to human psychology if gold becomes a reserve asset governments will see these miners going out of business and subsidize them which artificially decreased the cost of production further decreasing the price of gold miners are not the friends of gold investors they are the enemy since only 900 bitcoin are mined per day currently 6 25 per block if miners doubled network's hashrate tomorrow the supply would remain the same this is huge miners are securing the network which adds utility to bitcoin when utility is added the intrinsic value of bitcoin goes up which causes a positive feedback loop for price miners are the friends of investors this is a massive fundamental difference not even taking into account the 21 million supply max vs gold's infinite supply the additional ease of transportation digital utility etc if bitcoin and gold both become reserve assets do i believe the chinese government that they have the exact amount of gold in reserves as digitally printed money we have the trust that they're telling the public the truth with bitcoin governments can provably verify their reserves and we don't have to trust them anyone in the world can verify it for themselves this is fundamentally superior in a world where lies are everywhere at least you know your currency is sound,i'm selling my gold for

2020,1,451,8,458,,0,for the last few years i loved both gold and bitcoin although i had much more of my net worth in gold after much thought i've decided i will be soon liquidating my gold and buying more bitcoin here's why i believe after this whole covid shitshow is said and done fiat currencies are going to be fucked and all governments are going to realize that they must back their currency by some sort of reserve asset we really only have 3 options gold silver oil and bitcoin let's just disregard oil because we all know oil is slowly on it's way out with the way china is hoarding gold i believe china will back it's new central bank digital currency by gold reserves the whole world will start rethinking using the us dollar backed by nothing you can say army but that's not going to work for long the us isn't going to copy china and back their currency by gold again imo so i honestly think they'll choose bitcoin although i could easily be wrong anyways both gold and bitcoin are a good bet against fiat currencies the only problem is that when gold prices go up demand goes up a shitload more miners start mining gold and the price of gold eventually comes back down to it's cost of production and usually overshoots it to the downside due to human psychology if gold becomes a reserve asset governments will see these miners going out of business and subsidize them which artificially decreased the cost of production further decreasing the price of gold miners are not the friends of gold investors they are the enemy since only 900 bitcoin are mined per day currently 6 25 per block if miners doubled network's hashrate tomorrow the supply would remain the same this is huge miners are securing the network which adds utility to bitcoin when utility is added the intrinsic value of bitcoin goes up which causes a positive feedback loop for price miners are the friends of investors this is a massive fundamental difference not even taking into account the 21 million supply max vs gold's infinite supply the additional ease of transportation digital utility etc if bitcoin and gold both become reserve assets do i believe the chinese government that they have the exact amount of gold in reserves as digitally printed money we have the trust that they're telling the public the truth with bitcoin governments can provably verify their reserves and we don't have to trust them anyone in the world can verify it for themselves this is fundamentally superior in a world where lies are everywhere at least you know your currency is sound,i'm selling my gold for bitcoin here's why,i'm selling my gold for bitcoin here's whyfor the last few years i loved both gold and bitcoin although i had much more of my net worth in gold after much thought i've decided i will be soon liquidating my gold and buying more bitcoin here's why i believe after this whole covid shitshow is said and done fiat currencies are going to be fucked and all governments are going to realize that they must back their currency by some sort of reserve asset we really only have 3 options gold silver oil and bitcoin let's just disregard oil because we all know oil is slowly on it's way out with the way china is hoarding gold i believe china will back it's new central bank digital currency by gold reserves the whole world will start rethinking using the us dollar backed by nothing you can say army but that's not going to work for long the us isn't going to copy china and back their currency by gold again imo so i honestly think they'll choose bitcoin although i could

still the builder of bitcoin i thought i'd write about the last four years an eventful time for bitcoin and me for those who don't know me i'm hal finney i got my start in crypto working on an early version of pgp working closely with phil zimmermann when phil decided to start pgp corporation i was one of the first hires i would work on pgp until my retirement at the same time i got involved with the cypherpunks i ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer among other activities fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of bitcoin i've noticed that cryptographic graybeards i was in my mid 50's tend to get cynical i was more idealistic i have always loved crypto the mystery and the paradox of it when satoshi announced bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list he got a skeptical reception at best cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs they tend to have a knee jerk reaction i was more positive i had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes plus i was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both wei dai and nick szabo generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with bitcoin i had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency called rpow so i found bitcoin facinating when satoshi announced the first release of the software i grabbed it right away i think i was the first person besides satoshi to run bitcoin i mined block 70 something and i was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction when satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test i carried on an email conversation with satoshi over the next few days mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them today satoshi's true identity has become a mystery but at the time i thought i was dealing with a young man of japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere i've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life so i recognize the signs after a few days bitcoin was running pretty stably so i left it running those were the days when difficulty was 1 and you could find blocks with a cpu not even a gpu i mined several blocks over the next days but i turned it off because it made my computer run hot and the fan noise bothered me in retrospect i wish i had kept it up longer but on the other hand i was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning it's one of those glass half full half empty things the next i heard of bitcoin was late 2010 when i was surprised to find that it was not only still going bitcoins actually had monetary value i dusted off my old wallet and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there as the price climbed up to real money i transferred the coins into an offline wallet where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs speaking of heirs i got a surprise in 2009 when i was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease i was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year i'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running i'd run several half marathons and i was starting to train for a full marathon i worked my way up to 20 mile runs and i thought i was all set that's when everything went wrong my body began to fail i slurred my speech lost strength in my hands and my legs were slow to recover in august 2009 i was given the diagnosis of als also called lou gehrig's disease after the famous baseball player who got it als is a disease that kills moter neurons which carry signals from the brain to the muscles it causes first weakness then gradually increasing paralysis it is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years my symptoms were mild at first and i continued to work but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011 since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression today i am essentially paralyzed i am fed through a tube and my breathing is assisted through another tube i operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system it also has a speech synthesizer so this is my voice now i spend all day in my power wheelchair i worked up an interface using an arduino so that i can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes it has been an adjustment but my life is not too bad i can still read listen to music and watch tv and movies i recently discovered that i can even write code it's very slow probably 50 times slower than i was before but i still love programming and it gives me goals currently i'm working on something mike hearn suggested using the security features of modern processors designed to support trusted computing to harden bitcoin wallets it's almost ready to release i just have to do the documentation and of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me i have skin in the game but i came by my bitcoins through luck with little credit to me i lived through the crash of 2011 so i've seen it before easy come easy go that's my story i'm pretty lucky overall even with the als my life is very satisfying but my life expectancy is limited those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest my bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box and my son and daughter are tech savvy i think they're safe enough i'm comfortable with my legacy p s if something has to get to r all i wish it is some post like this so people can really see what bitcoin is and not just its price and

counterfeiters set about their work suppose the economy has a supply of 10 000 gold ounces and counterfeiters so cunning that they cannot be detected pump in 2 000 ounces more what will be the consequences first there will be a clear gain to the counterfeiters they take the newly created money and use it to buy goods and services the new money works its way step by step throughout the economic system as the new money spreads it bids prices up as we have seen new money can only dilute the effectiveness of each dollar but this dilution takes time and is therefore uneven in the meantime some people gain and other people lose in short the counterfeiters and their local retailers have found their incomes increased before any rise in the prices of the things they buy but on the other hand people in remote areas of the economy who have not yet received the new money find their buying prices rising before their incomes retailers at the other end of the country for example will suffer losses the first receivers of the new money gain most and at the expense of the latest receivers inflation then confers no general social benefit instead it redistributes the wealth in favor of the firstcomers and at the expense of the laggards in the race and inflation is in effect a race to see who can get the new money earliest the latecomers the ones stuck with the loss are often called the fixed income groups ministers teachers people on salaries lag notoriously behind other groups in acquiring the new money particular sufferers will be those depending on fixed money contracts contracts made in the days before the inflationary rise in prices life insurance beneficiaries and annuitants retired persons living off pensions landlords with long term leases bondholders and other creditors those holding cash all will bear the brunt of the inflation they will be the ones who are taxed inflation has other disastrous effects it distorts that keystone of our economy business calculation since prices do not all change uniformly and at the same speed it becomes very difficult for business to separate the lasting from the transitional and gauge truly the demands of consumers or the cost of their operations for example accounting practice enters the cost of an asset at the amount the business has paid for it but if inflation intervenes the cost of replacing the asset on the books as a result business accounting will seriously overstate their profits during inflation and may even consume capital while presumably increasing their investments similarly stockholders and real estate holders will acquire capital gains during an inflation that are not really gains at all but they may spend part of these gains without realizing that they are thereby consuming their original capital by creating illusory profits and distorting economic calculation inflation will suspend the free market s penalizing of inefficient and rewarding of efficient firms almost all firms will seemingly prosper the general atmosphere of a sellers market will lead to a decline in the quality of goods and of service to consumers since consumers often resist price increases less when they occur in the form of downgrading of quality the quality of work will decline in an inflation for a more subtle reason people become enamored of get rich quick schemes seemingly within their grasp in an era of ever rising prices and often scorn sober effort inflation also penalizes thrift and encourages debt for any sum of money loaned will be repaid in dollars of lower purchasing power than when originally received the incentive then is to borrow and repay later rather than save and lend inflation therefore lowers the general standard of living in the very course of creating a tinsel atmosphere of prosperity fortunately inflation cannot go on forever for eventually people wake up to this form of taxation they wake up to the continual shrinkage in the purchasing power of their dollar at first when prices rise people say well this is abnormal the product of some emergency i will postpone my purchases and wait until prices go back down this is the common attitude during the first phase of an inflation this notion moderates the price rise itself and conceals the inflation further since the demand for money is thereby increased but as inflation proceeds people begin to realize that prices are going up perpetually as a result of perpetual inflation now people will say i will buy now though prices are high because if i wait prices will go up still further as a result the demand for money now falls and prices go up more proportionately than the increase in the money supply at this point the government is often called upon to relieve the money shortage caused by the accelerated price rise and it inflates even faster soon the country reaches the stage of the crack up boom when people say i must buy anything now anything to get rid of money which depreciates on my hands the supply of money skyrockets the demand plummets and prices rise astronomically production falls sharply as people spend more and more of their time finding ways to get rid of their money the monetary system has in effect broken down completely and the economy reverts to other moneys if they are attainable other metal foreign currencies if this is a one country inflation or even a return to barter conditions the monetary system has broken down under the impact of inflation this condition of hyper inflation is familiar historically in the assignats of the french revolution the continentals of the american revolution and especially the german crisis of 1923 and the chinese and other currencies after world war ii a final indictment of inflation is that whenever the newly issued money is first used as loans to business inflation causes the dread business cycle this silent but deadly process undetected for generations works as follows new money is issued by the banking system under the aegis of government and loaned to business to businessmen the new funds seem to be genuine investments but these funds do not like free market investments arise from voluntary savings the new money is invested by businessmen in various projects and paid out to workers and other factors as higher wages and prices as the new money filters down to the whole economy the people tend to re establish their old voluntary consumption saving proportions in short if people wish to save and invest about 20 percent of their incomes and consume the rest new bank money loaned to business at

2019,1,1851,18,1868,,0,deflation the ethics of money production by jorg guido hulsmann still another variant of the same basic fallacy that we just discussed is the alleged need to fight deflation the word deflation can be defined in various ways according to the most widely accepted definition today deflation is a sustained decrease of the price level older authors have often used the expression deflation to denote a decreasing money supply and some contemporary authors use it to characterize a decrease of the inflation rate all of these definitions are acceptable depending on the purpose of the analysis none of them however lends itself to justifying an artificial increase of the money supply the harmful character of deflation is today one of the sacred dogmas of monetary policy the champions of the fight against deflation usually present six arguments to make their case 14 1 one in their eyes it is a matter of historical experience that deflation has negative repercussions on aggregate production and therefore on the standard of living to explain this presumed historical record they hold 1 two that deflation incites the market participants to postpone buying because they speculate on ever lower prices furthermore they consider 1 three that a declining price level makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past these difficulties threaten to entail 1 four a crisis within the banking industry and thus a dramatic curtailment of credit 1 five they claim that deflation in conjunction with sticky prices results in unemployment and finally 1 six they consider that deflation might reduce nominal interest rates to such an extent that a monetary policy of cheap money to stimulate employment and production would no longer be possible because the interest rate cannot be decreased below zero however theoretical and empirical evidence substantiating these claims is either weak or lacking altogether 15 first in historical fact deflation has had no clear negative impact on aggregate production long term decreases of the price level did not systematically correlate with lower growth rates than those that prevailed in comparable periods and or countries with increasing price levels even if we focus on deflationary shocks emanating from the financial system empirical evidence does not seem to warrant the general claim that deflation impairs long run growth 16 second it is true that unexpectedly strong deflation can incite people to postpone purchase decisions however this does not by any sort of necessity slow down aggregate production notice that in the presence of deflationary tendencies purchase decisions in general and consumption in particular does not come to a halt for one thing human beings act under the constraint of the stomach even the most neurotic misers who cherish saving a penny above anything else must make a minimum of purchases just to survive the next day and all others that is the great majority of the population will by and large buy just as many consumers goods as they would have bought in a nondeflationary environment even though they expect prices to decline ever further they will buy goods and services at some point because they prefer enjoying these goods and services sooner rather than later economists call this time preference in actual fact then consumption will slow down only marginally in a deflationary environment and this marginal reduction of consumer spending far from impairing aggregate production will rather tend to increase it the simple fact is that all resources that are not used for consumption are saved that is they are available for investment and thus help to extend production in those areas that previously were not profitable enough to warrant investment third it is correct that deflation especially unanticipated deflation makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past in the case of a massive deflation shock widespread bankruptcy might result such consequences are certainly deplorable from the standpoint of the individual entrepreneurs and capitalists who own the firms factories and other productive assets when the deflationary shock hits however from the aggregate social point of view it does not matter who controls the existing resources what matters from this overall point of view is that resources remain intact and be used now the important point is that deflation does not destroy these resources physically it merely diminishes their monetary value which is why their present owners go bankrupt thus deflation by and large boils down to a redistribution of productive assets from old owners to new owners the net impact on production is likely to be zero fourth it is true that deflation more or less directly threatens the banking industry because deflation makes it more difficult for bank customers to repay their debts and because widespread business failures are likely to have a direct negative impact on the liquidity of banks however for the same reasons that we just discussed while this might be devastating for some banks it is not so for society as a whole the crucial point is that bank credit does not create resources it channels existing resources into other businesses than those which would have used them if these credits had not existed it follows that a curtailment of bank credit does not destroy any resources it simply entails a different employment of human beings and of the available land factories streets and so on in the light of the preceding considerations it appears that the problems entailed by deflation are much less formidable than they are in the opinion of present day monetary authorities deflation certainly has much disruptive potential however as will become even more obvious in the following chapters it mainly threatens institutions that are responsible for inflationary increases of the money supply it reduces the wealth of fractional reserve banks and their customers debt ridden governments entrepreneurs and consumers but as we have argued such destruction liberates the underlying physical resources for new employment the destruction entailed by deflation is therefore often creative destruction in the schumpeterian sense 18 fifth in the past eighty years the sticky prices argument has played an important role in monetary debates according to this argument the manipulation of the money supply might be a suitable instrument to re establish a lost equilibrium on certain markets most notably on the labor market suppose that powerful labor unions push up nominal wage rates in all industries to such an extent that entrepreneurs can no longer profitably employ a great part of the workforce at these wages the result is mass unemployment but if it were possible to substantially increase the money supply then the selling prices of the entrepreneurs might rise enough to allow for the reintegration of the unemployed workers into the division of labor now the argument goes under a gold or silver standard this kind of policy is impossible for purely technical reasons because the money supply is inflexible only a paper money provides the technical wherewithal to implement pro employment policies thus we have here a prima facie justification for suppressing the natural commodity monies and supporting a paper money standard this argument grew into prominence during the 1920s in austria germany the united kingdom and other countries after world war ii it became something like a dogma of economic policy but this does not alter the fact that it is sheer fallacy and it is not even difficult to see the root of the fallacy the argument is in fact premised on the notion that monetary policy makers can constantly outsmart the labor unions the managers of the printing press can again and again surprise the labor union leaders through another round of expansionist monetary policy clearly this is a silly assumption and in retrospect it is very astonishing that responsible men could ever have taken it seriously the labor unions were not fooled faced with the reality of expansionist monetary policy they eventually increased their wage demands to compensate for the declining purchasing power of money the result was stagflation high unemployment plus inflation a phenomenon that in the past thirty years has come to plague countries with strong labor unions such as france and germany sixth another widespread fallacy is the idea that paper money could help to decrease the interest rate thus promoting economic growth if new paper tickets are printed and then first offered on the credit market so the argument goes the supply of credit is increased and as a consequence the price of credit interest declines cheap money is now available for businessmen all over the country they will invest more than they otherwise would have invested and therefore economic growth will be enhanced there are actually a good number of different fallacies involved in this argument and it is impossible for us to deal with all of them here 19 in short economic growth is diminished below the level it could otherwise have reached to sum up it is by no means sure that politically induced increases of the money supply will lead to a decrease of the interest rate below the level it would have reached in a free economy the success of cheap money policy is especially unlikely when the policy is not adopted on an ad hoc basis but turned into a guiding principle of economic policy but the fundamental objection to this policy is that it is counterproductive even if it succeeds in decreasing the interest rate the consequence would be more waste and thus less growth 14 for an overview see federal reserve bank of cleveland deflation 2002 annual report may 9 2003 r c k burdekin and p l siklos eds deflation current and historical

2019,1,3040,41,3080,,0,why is surprise the permanent condition of the u s political and economic elite in 2007 8 when the global financial system imploded the cry that no one could have seen this coming was heard everywhere despite the existence of numerous analyses showing that a crisis was unavoidable the critical issue is the artificial suppression of volatility the ups and downs of life in the name of stability it is both misguided and dangerous to push unobserved risks further into the statistical tails of the probability distribution of outcomes and allow these high impact low probability tail risks to disappear from policymakers fields of observation what the world is witnessing is simply what happens when highly constrained systems explode complex systems that have artificially suppressed volatility tend to become extremely fragile while at the same time exhibiting no visible risks in fact they tend to be too calm and exhibit minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the surface although the stated intention of political leaders and economic policymakers is to stabilize the system by inhibiting fluctuations the result tends to be the opposite these artificially constrained systems become prone to black swans that is they become extremely vulnerable to large scale events that lie far from the statistical norm and were largely unpredictable to a given set of observers such environments eventually experience massive blowups catching everyone off guard and undoing years of stability or in some cases ending up far worse than they were in their initial volatile state indeed the longer it takes for the blowup to occur the worse the resulting harm in both economic and political systems seeking to restrict variability seems to be good policy who does not prefer stability to chaos so it is with very good intentions that policymakers unwittingly increase the risk of major blowups and it is the same misperception of the properties of natural systems that led the economic crisis of 2007 8 the policy implications are to make systems robust all risks must be visible and out in the open fluctuat nec mergitur it fluctuates but does not sink goes the latin saying just as a robust economic system is one that encourages early failures the concepts of fail small and fail fast the u s government should stop supporting dictatorial regimes for the sake of pseudostability and instead allow political noise to rise to the surface making an economy robust in the face of business swings requires allowing risk to be visible the same is true in politics seduced by stability both the recent financial crisis and the political crises in the middle east are grounded in the rise of complexity interdependence and unpredictability policymakers in the uk and the usa have long promoted policies aimed at eliminating fluctuation no more booms and busts in the economy no more iranian surprises in foreign policy these policies have almost always produced undesirable outcomes for example the u s banking system became very fragile following a succession of progressively larger bailouts and government interventions particularly after the 1983 rescue of major banks ironically by the same reagan administration that trumpeted free markets in the united states promoting these bad policies has been a bipartisan effort throughout republicans have been good at fragilizing large corporations through bailouts and democrats have been good at fragilizing the government at the same time the financial system as a whole exhibited little volatility it kept getting weaker while providing policymakers with the illusion of stability illustrated most notably when ben bernanke who was then a member of the board of governors of the u s federal reserve declared the era of the great moderation in 2004 putatively independent central bankers fell into the same trap during the 1990s u s federal reserve chair alan greenspan wanted to iron out the economic cycle s booms and busts and he sought to control economic swings with interest rate reductions at the slightest sign of a downward tick in the economic data furthermore he adapted his economic policy to guarantee bank rescues with implicit promises of a backstop the now infamous greenspan put these policies proved to have grave delayed side effects washington stabilized the market with bailouts and by allowing certain companies to grow too big to fail because policymakers believed it was better to do something than to do nothing they felt obligated to heal the economy rather than wait and see if it healed on its own the foreign policy equivalent is to support the incumbent no matter what and just as banks took wild risks thanks to greenspan s implicit insurance policy client governments such as hosni mubarak s in egypt for years engaged in overt plunder thanks to similarly reliable u s support those who seek to prevent volatility on the grounds that any and all bumps in the road must be avoided paradoxically increase the probability that a tail risk will cause a major explosion consider a thought experiment a man placed in an artificially sterilized environment for a decade and then invited to take a ride on a crowded subway he would be expected to die quickly likewise preventing small forest fires can cause larger forest fires to become devastating this property is shared by all complex systems in the realm of economics price controls are designed to constrain volatility on the grounds that stable prices are a good thing but although these controls might work in some rare situations the long term effect of any such system is an eventual and extremely costly blowup whose cleanup costs can far exceed the benefits accrued the risks of a dictatorship no matter how seemingly stable are no different in the long run from those of an artificially controlled price such attempts to institutionally engineer the world come in two types those that conform to the world as it is and those that attempt to reform the world the nature of humans quite reasonably is to intervene in an effort to alter their world and the outcomes it produces but government interventions are laden with unintended and unforeseen consequences particularly in complex systems so humans must work with nature by tolerating systems that absorb human imperfections rather than seek to change them take for example the recent celebrated documentary on the financial crisis inside job which blames the crisis on the malfeasance and dishonesty of bankers and the incompetence of regulators although it is morally satisfying the film naively overlooks the fact that humans have always been dishonest and regulators have always been behind the curve the only difference this time around was the unprecedented magnitude of the hidden risks and a misunderstanding of the statistical properties of the system what is needed is a system that can prevent the harm done to citizens by the dishonesty of business elites the limited competence of forecasters economists and statisticians and the imperfections of regulation not one that aims to eliminate these flaws humans must try to resist the illusion of control just as foreign policy should be intelligence proof it should minimize its reliance on the competence of information gathering organizations and the predictions of experts in what are inherently unpredictable domains the economy should be regulator proof given that some regulations simply make the system itself more fragile due to the complexity of markets intricate regulations simply serve to generate fees for lawyers and profits for sophisticated derivatives traders who can build complicated financial products that skirt those regulations don t be a turkey the life of a turkey before thanksgiving is illustrative the turkey is fed for 1 000 days and every day seems to confirm that the farmer cares for it until the last day when confidence is maximal the turkey problem occurs when a naive analysis of stability is derived from the absence of past variations likewise confidence in stability was maximal at the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 the turkey problem for humans is the result of mistaking one environment for another humans simultaneously inhabit two systems the linear and the complex the linear domain is characterized by its predictability and the low degree of interaction among its components which allows the use of mathematical methods that make forecasts reliable in complex systems there is an absence of visible causal links between the elements masking a high degree of interdependence and extremely low predictability nonlinear elements are also present such as those commonly known and generally misunderstood as tipping points imagine someone who keeps adding sand to a sand pile without any visible consequence until suddenly the entire pile crumbles it would be foolish to blame the collapse on the last grain of sand rather than the structure of the pile but that is what people do consistently and that is the policy error u s president barack obama may blame an intelligence failure for the government s not foreseeing the revolution in egypt just as former u s president jimmy carter blamed an intelligence failure for his administration s not foreseeing the 1979 islamic revolution in iran but it is the suppressed risk in the statistical tails that matters not the failure to see the last grain of sand as a result of complicated interdependence and contagion effects in all man made complex systems a small number of possible events dominate namely black swans engineering architecture astronomy most of physics and much of common science are linear domains the complex domain is the realm of the social world epidemics and economics crucially the linear domain delivers mild variations without large shocks whereas the complex domain delivers massive jumps and gaps complex systems are misunderstood mostly because humans sophistication obtained over the history of human knowledge in the linear domain does not transfer properly to the complex domain humans can predict a solar eclipse and the trajectory of a space vessel but not the stock market or egyptian political events all man made complex systems have commonalities and even universalities sadly deceptive calm followed by black swan surprises seems to be one of those properties the error of prediction as with a crumbling sand pile it would be foolish to attribute the collapse of a fragile bridge to the last truck that crossed it and even more foolish to try to predict in advance which truck might bring it down the system is responsible not the components but after the financial crisis of 2007 8 many people thought that predicting the subprime meltdown would have helped it would not have since it was a symptom of the crisis not its underlying cause likewise obama s blaming bad intelligence for his administration s failure to predict the crisis in egypt is symptomatic of both the misunderstanding of complex systems and the bad policies involved obama s mistake illustrates the illusion of local causal chains that is confusing catalysts for causes and assuming that one can know which catalyst will produce which effect the final episode of the upheaval in egypt was unpredictable for all observers especially those involved as such blaming the cia is as foolish as funding it to forecast such events governments are wasting billions of dollars on attempting to predict events that are produced by interdependent systems and are therefore not statistically understandable at the individual level as mark abdollahian of sentia group one of the contractors who sell predictive analytics to the u s government noted regarding egypt policymakers should think of this like las vegas in blackjack if you can do four percent better than the average you re making real money but the analogy is spurious there is no four percent better on egypt this is not just money wasted but the construction of a false confidence based on an erroneous focus it is telling that the intelligence analysts made the same mistake as the risk management systems that failed to predict the economic crisis and offered the exact same excuses when they failed political and economic tail events are unpredictable and their probabilities are not scientifically measurable no matter how many dollars are spent on research predicting revolutions is not the same as counting cards humans will never be able to turn politics into the tractable randomness of blackjack most explanations being offered for the current turmoil in the middle east follow the catalysts as causes confusion the riots in tunisia and egypt were initially attributed to rising commodity prices not to stifling and unpopular dictatorships but bahrain and libya are countries with high gdps that can aªord to import grain and other commodities again the focus is wrong even if the logic is comforting it is the system and its fragility not events that must be studied what physicists call percolation theory in which the properties of the terrain are studied rather than those of a single element of the terrain when dealing with a system that is inherently unpredictable what should be done differentiating between two types of countries is useful in the first changes in government do not lead to meaningful diªerences in political outcomes since political tensions are out in the open in the second type changes in government lead to both drastic and deeply unpredictable changes consider that italy with its muchmaligned cabinet instability is economically and politically stable despite having had more than 60 governments since world war ii indeed one may say italy s stability is because of these switches of government similarly in spite of consistently bad press lebanon is a relatively safe bet in terms of how far governments can jump from equilibrium in spite of all the noise shifting alliances and street protests changes in government there tend to be comparatively mild for example a shift in the ruling coalition from christian parties to hezbollah is not such a consequential jump in terms of the country s economic and political stability switching equilibrium with control of the government changing from one party to another in such systems acts as a shock absorber since a single party cannot have total and more than temporary control the possibility of a large jump in the regime type is constrained in contrast consider iran and iraq mohammad reza shah pahlavi and saddam hussein both constrained volatility by any means necessary in iran when the shah was toppled the shift of power to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was a huge unforeseeable jump after the fact analysts could construct convincing accounts about how killing iranian communists driving the left into exile demobilizing the democratic opposition and driving all dissent into the mosque had made khomeini s rise inevitable in iraq the united states removed the lid and was actually surprised to find that the regime did not jump from hyperconstraint to something like france but this was impossible to predict ahead of time due to the nature of the system itself what can be said however is that the more constrained the volatility the bigger the regime jump is likely to be from the french revolution to the triumph of the bolsheviks history is replete with such examples and yet somehow humans remain unable to process what they mean humans fear randomness a healthy ancestral trait inherited from a different environment whereas in the past which was a more linear world this trait enhanced fitness and increased chances of survival it can have the reverse effect in today s complex world making volatility take the shape of nasty black swans hiding behind deceptive periods of great moderation this is not to say that any and all volatility should be embraced insurance should not be banned for example but alongside the catalysts as causes confusion sit two mental biases the illusion of control and the action bias the illusion that doing something is always better than doing nothing this leads to the desire to impose man made solutions greenspan s actions were harmful but it would have been hard to justify inaction in a democracy where the incentive is to always promise a better outcome than the other guy regardless of the actual delayed cost variation is information when there is no variation there is no information this explains the cia s failure to predict the egyptian revolution and a generation before the iranian revolution in both cases the revolutionaries themselves did not have a clear idea of their relative strength with respect to the regime they were hoping to topple so rather than subsidize and praise as a force for stability every tin pot potentate on the planet the u s government should encourage countries to let information flow upward through the transparency that comes with political agitation it should not fear fluctuations per se since allowing them to be in the open as italy and lebanon both show in different ways creates the stability of small jumps as seneca wrote in de clementia repeated punishment while it crushes the hatred of a few stirs the hatred of all just as trees that have been trimmed throw out again countless branches the imposition of peace through repeated punishment lies at the heart of many seemingly intractable conflicts including the israeli palestinian stalemate furthermore dealing with seemingly reliable high level offcials rather than the people themselves prevents any peace treaty signed from being robust the romans were wise enough to know that only a free man under roman law could be trusted to engage in a contract by extension only a free people can be trusted to abide by a treaty treaties that are negotiated with the consent of a broad swath of the populations on both sides of a conflict tend to survive just as no central bank is powerful enough to dictate stability no superpower can be powerful enough to guarantee solid peace alone u s policy toward the middle east has historically and especially since 9 11 been unduly focused on the repression of any and all political fluctuations in the name of preventing islamic fundamentalism a trope that mubarak repeated until his last moments in power and that libyan leader muammar al qaddafi continues to emphasize today blaming osama bin laden for what has befallen him this is wrong the west and its autocratic arab allies have strengthened islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground and even more so by killing them as jean jacques rousseau put it a little bit of agitation gives motivation to the soul and what really makes the species prosper is not peace so much as freedom with freedom comes some unpredictable fluctuation this is one of life s packages there is no freedom without noise and no stability without volatility,bitcoins volatility is a feature not a bug complex systems that have artificially suppressed volatility become fragile they tend

the same time the financial system as a whole exhibited little volatility it kept getting weaker while providing policymakers with the illusion of stability illustrated most notably when ben bernanke who was then a member of the board of governors of the u s federal reserve declared the era of the great moderation in 2004 putatively independent central bankers fell into the same trap during the 1990s u s federal reserve chair alan greenspan wanted to iron out the economic cycle s booms and busts and he sought to control economic swings with interest rate reductions at the slightest sign of a downward tick in the economic data furthermore he adapted his economic policy to guarantee bank rescues with implicit promises of a backstop the now infamous greenspan put these policies proved to have grave delayed side effects washington stabilized the market with bailouts and by allowing certain companies to grow too big to fail because policymakers believed it was better to do something than to do nothing they felt obligated to heal the economy rather than wait and see if it healed on its own the foreign policy equivalent is to support the incumbent no matter what and just as banks took wild risks thanks to greenspan s implicit insurance policy client governments such as hosni mubarak s in egypt for years engaged in overt plunder thanks to similarly reliable u s support those who seek to prevent volatility on the grounds that any and all bumps in the road must be avoided paradoxically increase the probability that a tail risk will cause a major explosion consider a thought experiment a man placed in an artificially sterilized environment for a decade and then invited to take a ride on a crowded subway he would be expected to die quickly likewise preventing small forest fires can cause larger forest fires to become devastating this property is shared by all complex systems in the realm of economics price controls are designed to constrain volatility on the grounds that stable prices are a good thing but although these controls might work in some rare situations the long term effect of any such system is an eventual and extremely costly blowup whose cleanup costs can far exceed the benefits accrued the risks of a dictatorship no matter how seemingly stable are no different in the long run from those of an artificially controlled price such attempts to institutionally engineer the world come in two types those that conform to the world as it is and those that attempt to reform the world the nature of humans quite reasonably is to intervene in an effort to alter their world and the outcomes it produces but government interventions are laden with unintended and unforeseen consequences particularly in complex systems so humans must work with nature by tolerating systems that absorb human imperfections rather than seek to change them take for example the recent celebrated documentary on the financial crisis inside job which blames the crisis on the malfeasance and dishonesty of bankers and the incompetence of regulators although it is morally satisfying the film naively overlooks the fact that humans have always been dishonest and regulators have always been behind the curve the only difference this time around was the unprecedented magnitude of the hidden risks and a misunderstanding of the statistical properties of the system what is needed is a system that can prevent the harm done to citizens by the dishonesty of business elites the limited competence of forecasters economists and statisticians and the imperfections of regulation not one that aims to eliminate these flaws humans must try to resist the illusion of control just as foreign policy should be intelligence proof it should minimize its reliance on the competence of information gathering organizations and the predictions of experts in what are inherently unpredictable domains the economy should be regulator proof given that some regulations simply make the system itself more fragile due to the complexity of markets intricate regulations simply serve to generate fees for lawyers and profits for sophisticated derivatives traders who can build complicated financial products that skirt those regulations don t be a turkey the life of a turkey before thanksgiving is illustrative the turkey is fed for 1 000 days and every day seems to confirm that the farmer cares for it until the last day when confidence is maximal the turkey problem occurs when a naive analysis of stability is derived from the absence of past variations likewise confidence in stability was maximal at the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 the turkey problem for humans is the result of mistaking one environment for another humans simultaneously inhabit two systems the linear and the complex the linear domain is characterized by its predictability and the low degree of interaction among its components which allows the use of mathematical methods that make forecasts reliable in complex systems there is an absence of visible causal links between the elements masking a high degree of interdependence and extremely low predictability nonlinear elements are also present such as those commonly known and generally misunderstood as tipping points imagine someone who keeps adding sand to a sand pile without any visible consequence until suddenly the entire pile crumbles it would be foolish to blame the collapse on the last grain of sand rather than the structure of the pile but that is what people do consistently and that is the policy error u s president barack obama may blame an intelligence failure for the government s not foreseeing the revolution in egypt just as former u s president jimmy carter blamed an intelligence failure for his administration s not foreseeing the 1979 islamic revolution in iran but it is the suppressed risk in the statistical tails that matters not the failure to see the last grain of sand as a result of complicated interdependence and contagion effects in all man made complex systems a small number of possible events dominate namely black swans engineering architecture astronomy most of physics and much of common science are linear domains the complex domain is the realm of the social world epidemics and economics crucially the linear domain delivers mild variations without large shocks whereas the complex domain delivers massive jumps and gaps complex systems are misunderstood mostly because humans sophistication obtained over the history of human knowledge in the linear domain does not transfer properly to the complex domain humans can predict a solar eclipse and the trajectory of a space vessel but not the stock market or egyptian political events all man made complex systems have commonalities and even universalities sadly deceptive calm followed by black swan surprises seems to be one of those properties the error of prediction as with a crumbling sand pile it would be foolish to attribute the collapse of a fragile bridge to the last truck that crossed it and even more foolish to try to predict in advance which truck might bring it down the system is responsible not the components but after the financial crisis of 2007 8 many people thought that predicting the subprime meltdown would have helped it would not have since it was a symptom of the crisis not its underlying cause likewise obama s blaming bad intelligence for his administration s failure to predict the crisis in egypt is symptomatic of both the misunderstanding of complex systems and the bad policies involved obama s mistake illustrates the illusion of local causal chains that is confusing catalysts for causes and assuming that one can know which catalyst will produce which effect the final episode of the upheaval in egypt was unpredictable for all observers especially those involved as such blaming the cia is as foolish as funding it to forecast such events governments are wasting billions of dollars on attempting to predict events that are produced by interdependent systems and are therefore not statistically understandable at the individual level as mark abdollahian of sentia group one of the contractors who sell predictive analytics to the u s government noted regarding egypt policymakers should think of this like las vegas in blackjack if you can do four percent better than the average you re making real money but the analogy is spurious there is no four percent better on egypt this is not just money wasted but the construction of a false confidence based on an erroneous focus it is telling that the intelligence analysts made the same mistake as the risk management systems that failed to predict the economic crisis and offered the exact same excuses when they failed political and economic tail events are unpredictable and their probabilities are not scientifically measurable no matter how many dollars are spent on research predicting revolutions is not the same as counting cards humans will never be able to turn politics into the tractable randomness of blackjack most explanations being offered for the current turmoil in the middle east follow the catalysts as causes confusion the riots in tunisia and egypt were initially attributed to rising commodity prices not to stifling and unpopular dictatorships but bahrain and libya are countries with high gdps that can aªord to import grain and other commodities again the focus is wrong even if the logic is comforting it is the system and its fragility not events that must be studied what physicists call percolation theory in which the properties of the terrain are studied rather than those of a single element of the terrain when dealing with a system that is inherently unpredictable what should be done differentiating between two types of countries is useful in the first changes in government do not lead to meaningful diªerences in political outcomes since political tensions are out in the open in the second type changes in government lead to both drastic and deeply unpredictable changes consider that italy with its muchmaligned cabinet instability is economically and politically stable despite having had more than 60 governments since world war ii indeed one may say italy s stability is because of these switches of government similarly in spite of consistently bad press lebanon is a relatively safe bet in terms of how far governments can jump from equilibrium in spite of all the noise shifting alliances and street protests changes in government there tend to be comparatively mild for example a shift in the ruling coalition from christian parties to hezbollah is not such a consequential jump in terms of the country s economic and political stability switching equilibrium with control of the government changing from one party to another in such systems acts as a shock absorber since a single party cannot have total and more than temporary control the possibility of a large jump in the regime type is constrained in contrast consider iran and iraq mohammad reza shah pahlavi and saddam hussein both constrained volatility by any means necessary in iran when the shah was toppled the shift of power to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was a huge unforeseeable jump after the fact analysts could construct convincing accounts about how killing iranian communists driving the left into exile demobilizing the democratic opposition and driving all dissent into the mosque had made khomeini s rise inevitable in iraq the united states removed the lid and was actually surprised to find that the regime did not jump from hyperconstraint to something like france but this was impossible to predict ahead of time due to the nature of the system itself what can be said however is that the more constrained the volatility the bigger the regime jump is likely to be from the french revolution to the triumph of the bolsheviks history is replete with such examples and yet somehow humans remain unable to process what they mean humans fear randomness a healthy ancestral trait inherited from a different environment whereas in the past which was a more linear world this trait enhanced fitness and increased chances of survival it can have the reverse effect in today s complex world making volatility take the shape of nasty black swans hiding behind deceptive periods of great moderation this is not to say that any and all volatility should be embraced insurance should not be banned for example but alongside the catalysts as causes confusion sit two mental biases the illusion of control and the action bias the illusion that doing something is always better than doing nothing this leads to the desire to impose man made solutions greenspan s actions were harmful but it would have been hard to justify inaction in a democracy where the incentive is to always promise a better outcome than the other guy regardless of the actual delayed cost variation is information when there is no variation there is no information this explains the cia s failure to predict the egyptian revolution and a generation before the iranian revolution in both cases the revolutionaries themselves did not have a clear idea of their relative strength with respect to the regime they were hoping to topple so rather than subsidize and praise as a force for stability every tin pot potentate on the planet the u s government should encourage countries to let information flow upward through the transparency that comes with political agitation it should not fear fluctuations per se since allowing them to be in the open as italy and lebanon both show in different ways creates the stability of small jumps as seneca wrote in de clementia repeated punishment while it crushes the hatred of a few stirs the hatred of all just as trees that have been trimmed throw out again countless branches the imposition of peace through repeated punishment lies at the heart of many seemingly intractable conflicts including the israeli palestinian stalemate furthermore dealing with seemingly reliable high level offcials rather than the people themselves prevents any peace treaty signed from being robust the romans were wise enough to know that only a free man under roman law could be trusted to engage in a contract by extension only a free people can be trusted to abide by a treaty treaties that are negotiated with the consent of a broad swath of the populations on both sides of a conflict tend to survive just as no central bank is powerful enough to dictate stability no superpower can be powerful enough to guarantee solid peace alone u s policy toward the middle east has historically and especially since 9 11 been unduly focused on the repression of any and all political fluctuations in the name of preventing islamic fundamentalism a trope that mubarak repeated until his last moments in power and that libyan leader muammar al qaddafi continues to emphasize today blaming osama bin laden for what has befallen him this is wrong the west and its autocratic arab allies have strengthened islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground and even more so by killing them as jean jacques rousseau put it a little bit of agitation gives motivation to the soul and what really makes the species prosper is not peace so much as freedom with freedom comes some unpredictable fluctuation this is one of life s packages there is no freedom without noise and no stability without volatility,

2019,1,555,20,574,,0,i know that if you look at bitcoin it's hard to believe the last ten years could be repeated most of the people who have an exposure to bitcoin thought the same when looking at it in 2017 when it was below 4k or even further down the road when it was at 1k or when it was at 400 a coin etc try to look at why it came from sub dollar a coin to where we are now the fundamentals are the same but everything around it has evolved in making it's usage better bitcoin still has by far the biggest development team behind it it's still evolving and not like most shitcoins just a copy of something existing with one or a few improvements that are sold by smart salesman as the next revolution but mostly right after that fall dead in the water because maintenance or development goes quickly to zero look at what is happening to the debts building up everywhere individual governments companies banks how is that ever going to be paid back just by printing more of it is it possible to just keep on creating money with no end if it's that easy wouldn't we all be rich already by banks just printing infinite amounts and giving it to all of us even of you don't understand how the fiat system works you probably will realize we cannot create wealth by just printing fiat but that is the only thing we are doing right know and have been doing for a long time bitcoin is like gold in that respect it can't be created at almost no cost like fiat can so it can't create inflation like printing fiat does bitcoin is sound money like gold and silver once was but just modern version better suited for and made possible by computers and the internet if bitcoin will succeed in reaching its ultimate goal we will have a lot wealth that has to be flowing into it in fact we would only just have being started with that process no one can quarantee it will succeed since nobody can look into the future so don't invest more than you can afford is rule 1 but the longer it survives the bigger the chances of succeeding will be you can wait for it to prove its ultimate destination but then you will also be paying the amount of wealth it will represent at that time if you get onboard in a suitably time does 80 below last ath sound good enough you could enjoy the ride up with us know where you put your money in is rule 2 so read up on what bitcoin is how it works if you do not own your private key you don't own your coins is rule 3 keep your amount of wealth to yourself would be 4 there are more things you should know but if 4 don't let anyone or anything stop you from having some exposure to bitcoin not because you will help me or other bitcoin owners but simply because having no exposure is in my believe a bigger risk than having a balanced exposure to it even when i tell you you can lose that part completely let me finish with 5 just have some patience,don't let your belief that bitcoin can't double ten or hundred fold again prevent you from having some bitcoin

about $100 million spread across major exchanges u s based coinbase and kraken and luxembourg based bitstamp there has been a single order that has been algorithmically managed across these three venues of around 20 000 btc he said if you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges there were in concert synchronized units of volume of around 7 000 btc in an hour so there was an influx of some $100 million that caused bitcoin to rise $1000 a coin yes i guess it triggered some shorts to be covered etc but an influx of $100 million is just a small amount when looking at some budgets

effect of that $100 million influx bitcoin would rise $5000 a coin what if russia would do that the coming 12 months what if china decided to join after some months what if they would double that amount you can bet other countries wouldn't be just watching and see where the price would go to nor would the average investor and others it will simply be a waterfall of countries investors companies and normal people who will blindly jump in and the absurd price movements would make december 2017 look like a minor spike on the charts wishful thinking absurd dreaming you say well guess what i was told halfway 2017 when i said i expected bitcoin to be worth more than $10 k within 5 years time how could i know it would be double that prediction in only 6 months it's simple math if governments pension funds investors etc will just be toe tipping into bitcoin the price movements will be so big that december 2017 will look like a warmup party there will be so many spikes like today and bigger for such a long time it will be on every news outlet in each newspaper be talked about at every coffee machine and here at reddit we will see people go crazy like never before at this moment it's still a gamble if this will work out let alone when so invest only what you are willing to loose but once it gains momentum don't think you will have much time left to start learning about it setup an account start accumulating i simply don't see any other escape from the devastating fiat ponzy we are in right now it will be both the realization of the worthlessness of fiat combined with the insight that bitcoin is different that will cause an unstoppable wealth transfer when will you start to see it start to believe in it start to transfer your wealth into bitcoin at 10k at 100k why don't you think out a plan make up your mind about what would convince you bitcoin isn't some scam at what price level would you think it is safe to gamble invest 1 of your wealth into it when to invest 10 of your wealth in it would you be ready if the first pension fund announced it invested in it or if a small country would admit it put some of it's reserves into it just think about it make a plan be ahead of the herds the next ath will probably take the price to a level where an average family will have a very hard time to just get 1 bitcoin but could easily take it to levels it will just become impossible even if after that ath it would drop again with 70 80 it will very likely be way above the current price and if you would go and explore above samples and realize how much money will be involved it's hard to imagine it will ever again reach current levels once those gates are opened compare it to what it would take to invest $5 k right now i try to explain i think it's a bigger risk to have no exposure at all than to miss out if bitcoin would succeed don't go crazy with your exposure but investing some money you can miss to me that is more sound than dismissing bitcoin all together don't just believe what i say learn what bitcoin is how it works make sure you understand where you put your hard earned money into but start learning today you won't be able to go back in time,if an influx of some $100 million moves the price of one bitcoin with a $1000.........,if an influx of some $100 million moves the price of one bitcoin with a $1000......... i saw this on zero hedge oliver von landsberg sadie chief executive of london based cryptocurrency firm bcb group said the move was likely triggered by an algorithmic order worth about $100 million spread across major exchanges u s based coinbase and kraken and luxembourg based bitstamp there has been a single order that has been algorithmically managed across these three venues of around 20 000 btc he said if you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges there were in concert synchronized units of volume of around 7 000 btc in an hour so there was an influx of some $100 million that caused bitcoin to rise $1000 a coin yes i guess it triggered some shorts to be covered etc but an influx of $100 million is just a small amount when looking at some budgets russia is roughly buying a million

btc it looks like a lot of people were afraid of what could happen to bitcoin if it was hardforked would it survive and here we are now even at 3k bitcoin when you look at old discussions that took place when bitcoin was in the $8 and teens range hell look at the attitude people had towards bitcoin when it finally started having monetary value 3k it is doing fantastic and look at it climbing i was reading through an old ebay thread from 2010 or 2011 maybe i wish i could find it in my browsing history i can t any more and someone tried to pitch ebay accepting bitcoin and they were ridiculed away and heavily rejected for even pitching the idea and here we are now ebay announced they ll start accepting bitcoin last month i m seeking some honest evaluation by anyone reading what are some threats that exist on bitcoin s horizon here are some things that come to mind that i am wondering about 1 bug in the software that causes a flash crash of the price or irredeemably wrecks the software is that even possible 2 the people that contribute to the code fuck up or there is some silent code change is this even possible consider this satoshi silently added the 1mb limit when it was still being hosted on sorceforge i am wondering about people who say that their fork is the real bitcoin and call btc things like segwit coin my understanding is that segwit has no downsides and reduces fees and that big blockers are just bullshitting i like the decentralization aspect of bitcoin 3 are mining pools a point of potential weakness my understanding is that they are not decentralized 4 when someone starts accepting bitcoin but they immediately convert it to fiat and sell or they go thru a company that does this is that bad for bitcoin there s a reddit post 4 or 5 years ago on this subreddit where jimmywales1 says he started a bitcoin wallet was receiving donations will be cashing them out and donating the money to wikipedia and users were urging him to keep the bitcoin as bitcoin did wikipedia ever start accepting bitcoin donations do they still immediately cash out is it still considered a highly speculative asset or do they now hold some jimmy wales says that they hold a few different currencies that they actively use so it would be interesting to see if in 2019 wikipedia is now holding some coins themselves as is that would be a really big indicator for where we are headed with bitcoin finally where do you personally see the end of bitcoin being i m in the bitcoin subreddit i realize but i do not think that discards anyone from being able to think critically and take a look at the network and try to assign value to it for example i recall someone writing in an old post from maybe 2010 that buying bitcoin now is basically like buying manhattan for a quarter hindsight is 20 20 when did you first hear about bitcoin what year price was it did you hear about it and not pay attention to it at first even gregory maxwell dismissed bitcoin at first looking at it now where do you think it will end up looking like will it save the world will it save all of the dying children in the world i think roger ver said something about bitcoin saving all the dead babies 2009 2019 where do you foresee bitcoin being in 2029 i wish we could confidently look into the future and say it will at least be greater than 9k usd for each coin we can t really confidently say that though can we what if it isn t as liquid as it is now is that even possible have we hit the point of no return with bitcoin is it officially established no way to tell huh thank you for reading,looking at old bitcoin blog posts articles forum discussion videos etc and a rough qualitative analysis,looking at old bitcoin blog posts articles forum discussion

from being able to think critically and take a look at the network and try to assign value to it for example i recall someone writing in an old post from maybe 2010 that buying bitcoin now is basically like buying manhattan for a quarter hindsight is 20 20 when did you first hear about bitcoin what year price was it did you hear about it and not pay attention to it at first even gregory maxwell dismissed bitcoin at first looking at it now where do you think it will end up looking like will it save the world will it save all of the dying children in the world i think roger ver said something about bitcoin saving all the dead babies 2009 2019 where do you foresee bitcoin being in 2029 i wish we could confidently look into the future and say it will at least be greater than 9k usd for each coin we can t really confidently say that though can we what if it isn t as liquid as it is now is that even possible have we hit the point of no return with bitcoin is it officially established no way to tell huh thank you for reading,

2021,0,741,10,750,,0,caveat emptor for those of you that do not already know coinbase is going to be filing for a public ipo offering within the next 2 weeks analysts that study crypto chain stock indicate that coinbase is expected to have a market evaluation of roughly $70 000 000 000 00 usd to put this into perspective this would make coinbase worth more than companies like procter amp gamble the walt disney corporation fedex metlife insurance pepsico this evaluation puts coinbase at expected 47th spot on the fortune 500 companies list shares for coinbase are currently expected to be trading at roughly 200 00 usd per share minimum keep in mind 1 stock of microsoft msft is currently trading as of this post on april 4th 2021 at $242.35 usd coinbase has the potential to have stock that is worth more than a large number of fortune 500 stocks so what does this mean for dogecoin well as coinabse offers it's ipo all crypto will see a dramatic increase in value for dogecoin this will be the time that dogecoin spikes above the $0.11 usd mark with dogecoin possibly getting as high as $0.15 usd with an expected new floor of around $0.125 usd time will show if dogecoin keeps it's value or if it drops below expected floors it depends on how perceptive the market is to purchasing the stock offerings from coinbase there will be an initial price surge in doge following the ipo release date though that will definitively see dogecoin go over $0.11 usd so how do we get these numbers well $0.15 usd is roughly 2 5x on average the current price of dogecoin because of the immense value of coinbase and their ipo it would be asinine to not assume that doge will at least double it's current market value keep in mind that these numbers are extremely conservative and doge could possibly spike significantly higher to be fair i do not feel that this will be the trigger that gets doge over $1.00 usd as i am not an expert in calculating futures and want to be generally conservative with floor and ceiling estimates my associates degree is in software development not financial securities trading what will be really telling is the number of hedge funds that pick up coinbase as a stock option if companies like j p morgan chase or fidelity investments purchase stock options in coinbase for use in their investment hedge funds it will greatly normalize the use of crypto stock as an investment medium which in turn validates crypto currency as an investment medium we will greatly benefit if major investment firms start utilizing coinbase ipo stock offerings for investment purposes long story short the time is now to buy additional dogecoin if possible past the ipo launch date it may become impossible to purchase doge for less than $0.10 usd of course only invest what you can and what you think is feasible for you what we need to look out for is pump and dump or inverse ladder attacks epecially during the days preceding and the few days after the coinbase ipo people or investment firms with substantial standing may attempt to make dogecoin surge because of it's currently low value this could take dogecoin sky high but then make it crash by conducting mass selloffs then re buying in with profit this type of artificial options gaining is unnatural and will only make dogecoin plummet the idea here would be to attempt to invalidate coinbase and it's ipo by making crypto appear to be much more volatile than it is that isn't to say that crypto isn't volatile in it's own ways but this would be considered extremely artificially volatile there are a lot of investment firms and people with substantial fiat value that are afraid of decentralized currency and i would honestly not be surprised if something of this nature didn't happen or at least attempt to happen in the future this would be the absolute worst case scenario which i honestly don't see happening if something of this nature were to happen it would probably be done with a coin that has a moderately high value like litecoin or ripple amp x200b tl dr buy additional doge now if possible as the coinbase ipo on april 14th 2021 may make doge impossible to be purchased for

2021,0,494,11,504,,0,i just wanted to clarify one thing since a lot of bs is being shoveled with respect to doge being inflationary the idea that 10 000 doge are mined every minute giving 14 400 000 new doge every day is accurate but is only an issue if the miners sell simply speaking the way this works is that 'miners' are given an allocation of doge as a reward for 'mining' doge but this does not necessarily mean that the miner has to immediately sell the doge as they can hold on to it and 'bank' the doge into their wallets now this is the important part as long as there is greater demand for doge than new coins mined the price will keep going up also the miners who are allocated the doge would have to sell at market price to drive the price down which is not in their best interest think about it if you were mining doge are you going to sell at market once you get your allocation and then drive down the price so the coins you mine in the future are worth less or are you going to 'bank' the doge so the price keeps going up making you even more money then during price spikes you sell a portion of your doge to fund the mining and hodl the rest so the price is not adversely affected if the miners drive down the price by immediately selling their doge once they get it the price will fall and then they will make less money in the future this is what happens with btc the bitcoin miners don't immediately sell once they mine btc no the bank the btc until a price spike and then sell for a profit but not so much as to drive down the price too much as this would cause the value of future btc mined to be less people want to make more money from crypto not less so the miners are not going to drive down the price so their future mining is less profitable no they are going to hodl to make more money then sell a little for profit to fund their mining then repeat tl dr even though the number is doge is going up each day it is in the best interest of the miners to hodl and accumulate doge wealth allowing the price to rise rather than sell quickly and drive down the price in the future and make less money mining down the road this is why acceptance of doge as an everyday currency is so important let's assume a day when amazon accepts doge for the miners this is a huge win as rather than selling doge at market and driving down the price they can buy actual merchandise with doge and have less an effect on the price of doge but get real world value for mining miners want the price of doge to go up not down,'inflationary' doge supply doesn't necessarily mean the price will go down,'inflationary' doge supply doesn't necessarily mean the price will go downi just wanted to clarify one thing since a lot of bs is being shoveled with respect to doge being inflationary

be the next big thing or for a lack of better terms the one coin that can completely revolutionize cryptocurrency for starters doge has one of the most unique communities in terms of activity and size i m guessing that many of us come from different backgrounds and have different professional experiences the one thing that unites us is our love for doge however our community needs to take time and analyze the future of doge doge has hit a plateau which demands immediate attention by taking a closer look at the numbers we can see that doge lives in a constant yo yo like environment it goes up a bit and then it corrects itself never reaching or advancing past its projections there s no reason for doge not to have reached the top 10 or at least be worth more than coins like ripple if we don t take action the future is bleak we need to define what we want to do with doge do we want a coin that can be potentially life changing for many of us or do we want to keep the status quo where our coin is seen more like a meme than anything else it is important to mention that doge lacks leadership we lack a figure head that can provide the necessary vision or guidance to help the coin take the next step we are facing an immediate financial crisis after the coronavirus pandemic ends that means that most people will look for ways to safeguard their assets bitcoin is a great coin but it lacks a committed community like ours or the simplicity that doge provides also i m sure we have people here that are suffering financially and any jump in price will help them my proposal i m proposing to create the doge coin collective this collective will look for ways to make doge coin more mainstream and also for ways to make it more valuable the second step should be to explore capping doge coin at least temporarily this will certainly give us an opportunity to create more valuation and a more centralized approach where we pause and explore better ways to utilize doge the cap should be temporary the elon musk effect doge has the support of arguably one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history we should be capitalizing on his endorsement we should explore the possibility of creating some buzz about dogecoin using celebrities or influencers new dogecoin market exchange binance coinbase or robinhood haven t done much to make exchanging doge easier or more accessible to the amateur trader therefore we should explore creating a doge market exchange where trading is easier and where people have more access to the coin in addition we should redefine how the coin is utilized take for example the current situation where sadly people don t have access to some of the most basic items if we had a market where you could exchange doge for goods or services then it would ve made life easier for many of us here to finalize there s no doubt that doge coin is very special and have the potential to have a meaningful impact in our daily lives however if we don t take immediate action it s future is bleak at best i predict that we ll lose roughly 25 40 of our community within the next 12 24 months given the unpredictability of the current economy if we enter a recession people will start panicking and will start selling their coins the would be devastating for doge the good news is that we have time and the human capital to take necessary action in order to preserve the future of our beloved coin remember this is mere a suggestion and i would love you get meaningful feedback,the future of doge coin,the future of doge coinimagine being in the ocean and trying to

be the next big thing or for a lack of better terms the one coin that can completely revolutionize cryptocurrency for starters doge has one of the most unique communities in terms of activity and size i m guessing that many of us come from different backgrounds and have different professional experiences the one thing that unites us is our love for doge however our community needs to take time and analyze the future of doge doge has hit a plateau which demands immediate attention by taking a closer look at the numbers we can see that doge lives in a constant yo yo like environment it goes up a bit and then it corrects itself never reaching or advancing past its projections there s no reason for doge not to have reached the top 10 or at least be worth more than coins like ripple if we don t take action the future is bleak we need to define what we want to do with doge do we want a coin that can be potentially life changing for many of us or do we want to keep the status quo where our coin is seen more like a meme than anything else it is important to mention that doge lacks leadership we lack a figure head that can provide the necessary vision or guidance to help the coin take the next step we are facing an immediate financial crisis after the coronavirus pandemic ends that means that most people will look for ways to safeguard their assets bitcoin is a great coin but it lacks a committed community like ours or the simplicity that doge provides also i m sure we have people here that are suffering financially and any jump in price will help them my proposal i m proposing to create the doge coin collective this collective will look for ways to make doge coin more mainstream and also for ways to make it more valuable the second step should be to explore capping doge coin at least temporarily this will certainly give us an opportunity to create more valuation and a more centralized approach where we pause and explore better ways to utilize doge the cap should be temporary the elon musk effect doge has the support of arguably one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history we should be capitalizing on his endorsement we should explore the possibility of creating some buzz about dogecoin using celebrities or influencers new dogecoin market exchange binance coinbase or robinhood haven t done much to make exchanging doge easier or more accessible to the amateur trader therefore we should explore creating a doge market exchange where trading is easier and where people have more access to the coin in addition we should redefine how the coin is utilized take for example the current situation where sadly people don t have access to some of the most basic items if we had a market where you could exchange doge for goods or services then it would ve made life easier for many of us here to finalize there s no doubt that doge coin is very special and have the potential to have a meaningful impact in our daily lives however if we don t take immediate action it s future is bleak at best i predict that we ll lose roughly 25 40 of our community within the next 12 24 months given the unpredictability of the current economy if we enter a recession people will start panicking and will start selling their coins the would be devastating for doge the good news is that we have time and the human capital to take necessary action in order to preserve the future of our beloved coin remember this is mere a suggestion and i would love you get meaningful feedback,the future of doge coin,the future of doge coinimagine being in the ocean and trying to
