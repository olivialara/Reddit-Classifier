"Hey my wsb friends, I know some of you already have some bitcoin, but I imagine lots of you are just starting to learn about it, so I'm going to borrow your meme for a second to explain why I like the coin, and I hope that resonates with you, because your message sure resonated with me.

1) The coin is yours. Like all of this bullshit we are seeing with the trade being shut down arbitrarily, and blatant manipulation, many of you will realize that your stake in the current system is not even really yours, the dollar is just a number on *their* database, and unfortunately the GME stock is also just a number on *their* database. With the coin, *your* stake is on *our* database, that's the power of the open and decentralized system, and is a paradigm shift. 

2) The coin is democratic. I know that today in the developed world we are mainly using it as a kind of investment, but in many places people are benefiting from the open nature of the system and are actively using it to escape authoritarian regimes like Venezuela, and completely stupid governments like Argentina, as well as being used by popular movements like in Nigeria. Either way, the coin is a win win for everyone, rich or poor.

3) The coin is inclusive. The coin doesn't care about your gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion or employment status. Everyone is welcome to participate. 

4) The coin is free. The idea of freedom is central to bitcoin, unlike fiat you are not forced to use it, yet millions of people are coming together and voluntarily adopting it, in a big display of freedom of choice, and in my view also a peaceful protests against the current institutions, you can opt-out of the current system.

I hope that you join us, and HODL strong with üíéüôå.

" Hedge funds are shorting bitcoin by nearly a billion dollars. As I see it, bitcoin has made it into the Institutional Buyin phase, a lot of people including Musk are now repping it, and now the majority around the world has lost their faith in Wall Street after the massive manipulation. 

Not only would a squeeze on Bitcoin hurt the hedge funds massively,  investing in Bitcoin already takes profits away from billionaires and Wall Street, but it is inevitable in the state that Wall Street is in after they completely screwed themselves with what happened. 

In the current economic state, people are also seeing bitcoin as an excellent store of value. The more inflated the dollar gets, the more bitcoins value launches. This was already a perfect catalyst for bitcoin, but after the world saw Wall Streets blatant attempt of Market Manipulation, bitcoin's mass adoption in the trading world is inevitable.

"Bitcoin has a 1% short interest. GME had a 140% short interest. That's how the squeeze worked there. Also, bitcoin has a $600B market cap, and most/all of the shorts are done with futures/CFDs that could maybe be cancelled. So it wouldn't work with BTC.

Also, this is an insult to Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not need your help with some kind of artificially induced pump or scheme. Bitcoin is not a meme stock to toy with. Bitcoin is the future of money. Bitcoin actually has fundamentals and networking to support its price growth. In 5 years, Bitcoin will probably still be holding this level or higher and going up. We don't need investors hearing that bitcoin is a game and has to be manipulated in order to go up.

&gt; Nice to see that despite the massive FUD from the last week we saw a solid hodler-floor of 30k that this time couldn¬¥t be breached.
&gt; 
&gt; The massive combined campaign included the FUD regarding:
&gt;

&gt;  ***""Endgame: The Unraveling"".***

https://medium.com/@fatherdoctorbitcoiner/endgame-the-unraveling-ccbbb5cd567b

The piece is mind-blowing in many ways, describes the situation that lead to this moment and the few possible scenarios, and have this clear: Any final scenario will be historic.

Bitcoin addressed here:

&gt; To prop up the market and prevent the entire financial system from melting down, the Fed will have no choice but to do QE infinity and continue to prop up asset prices and now with Janet Yellen in the Treasury, the debt will be directly monetized in the form of direct payments. This will finally cause the inflation, even hyperinflation that Lacy Hunt has warned about if the Fed were to directly monetize the treasury‚Äôs debt. Once inflation starts, like a horse out of a barn, it will be nearly impossible to rein it in without turning into Scenario #1. It will spiral out of control and cause incredible amount of pain to EVERYONE, globally, as every Central Bank will have to do the same if the US Fed monetizes the national debt. Once this happens, **people will end up owning bitcoin not out of any moral justification or idealism that maximalists espouse, but because it will be the only thing that people will accept for payment for goods and services as the USD is destroyed as a store of value.** This is Scenario #2. It will make Scenario #1 look like the Garden of Eden.

Also, regarding Bitcoin, one of the many ways this is relevant to Bitcoin users is this one:

Robbing Hood is going down, one way or another, next week or next month. There are hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of users holding what they may believe is ""Bitcoin"" there, it is not, but just an IOU. You can't even withdraw or transfer Bitcoin from there, you have to ""sell"" it for fiat first.

If you have ""Bitcoin"" there: DO SO NOW, get out whatever you have in Robbing Hood, in any way, before it blows up. You can continue holding and  supporting GME, AMC, etc. on more trusted platforms and  Hodling Bitcoin on your own hard wallet (""Not your keys, not your coins"") or on decentralized exchanges:

Let's warn as many people as we can, it would be a shame we have another Mt.Gox where thousands lose all their life savings due to another centralized massive failure.

Feel free to post this on r/WSB, I was banned a way back for mentioning the word 'Bitcoin' there, I hope that with this mess they start warming up to this decentralized option.

"STOP ASKING ABOUT THE NEXT DIP AND READ CAREFULLY

It's pointless to try and time the  market. Bitcoin has an average of 200% gains every year since it was  invented. I am not a day trader, I don't give a flying fuck what the new  ""price floor"" is. As someone who has been watching the market for 7 years I can tell you this: Buy as much of it as you can whenever you can afford it. Wait 5 years, and thank me. Every single person with experience will tell you  the same thing. STOP TRYING TO TIME THE MARKET AND JUST BUY. I could  give you my opinion about the short term price action, but I could be  wrong and it doesn't really matter anyways. The money you may save is  not enough to justify sitting on the side lines. If it hits 220K this  year and falls back to 50k, then you will just tell yourself it's too late and ""I should have bought in at $33,000"". DO YOU GET IT YET? If you buy in at $33k and it falls, to $20k, who the fuck cares? Buy more. In 5 years your $33k buy will be worth a shit load. Not to mention you will be a part of the new monetary network.

Even though I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, I can tell you what I personally think will happen. 30k is our support level for now until price breaks bullish. It will have an incredible run up to  somewhere near 220k and fall to an unknown level. Could be 50k, could  be 100k. I doubt it will fall below 40k ever again after it makes this run because there are too many strong hands in Bitcoin now unlike 2017.  Historical data is useless when talking Bitcoin because it's an emerging technology unlike other comparative assets. There is no guarantee of anything. If you buy in at 200k IT IS STILL A SMART MOVE because I think Bitcoin's true value is in the millions.

"Mike Green is salty, and likes to sprinkle his salty FUD in every interview (on Macro Voices, Real Vision, and the Grant Williams Podcast...). 

‚ÄúOne of the underlying features of Bitcoin is this idea that it has survived. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, I actually think 2021 is going to be the year in which that we discover that what we think is today Bitcoin is actually not Bitcoin. I know that sounds cryptic and I‚Äôm not prepared to reveal a lot of the work that I‚Äôve done in this area, but I do think that the general theory that Bitcoin is going to evade the response from the US government for long enough for it to become established is misplaced.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs alluding to here (do you?), but based on the other interviews I‚Äôve heard him in I don‚Äôt think he fully understands how established Bitcoin is throughout the world and how any country that prohibits its use will be doing themselves a disservice.

"It started in 2008 with the financial crash. I couldn't understand how it happened, and so I dived down the rabbit hole and learnt about the creation of money. That blew my mind. Somewhere around this time, Max Keiser started his campaign 'Buy Silver crash J P Morgan.' That was enough for me and I was in. Me and millions of others bought physical silver, kilos of it in bars and coins. We then sat back and waited for the crash, it didn't happen. Why?, because J P Morgan got out of it's short position and that was that. They always will. They own wallstreet the media all of it.

During this time I would be on ZH arguing against Bitcoin and for Silver. I was in IT my whole life, but just thought that Bitcoin was stupid. One day while having a major fall out with someone on ZH, I realised that I actually didn't know what I was talking about, and that I knew nothing about Bitcoin. And so I read the white paper. Before I had even finished reading it, I was converted. 20 mins later I was back on ZH saying just how wrong I had been.

I started buying small amounts of Bitcoin in late 2016 early 2017. I bought all the way up to the top, and all the way back down again. DCA all the way. I sold my silver at at a loss, and put that money into Bitcoin. The best thing I ever did.

I am writing this here as I have been trying to let people know that buying silver now is still a waste of money if you want to change the system. Bitcoin is the ONLY way this will happen. You have to separate the state from money creation. It's the only way that you can beat the system that has been evolved to not include you. Today I am still buying Bitcoin along with all my friends and some family. 99.9% of my wealth is in Bitcoin. I would never sell not if it went to -0. Long live Satoshi and coders that are making this happen. For everyone involved with it, even the ones I don't agree with. The common ground here is change, and complete and total change the likes of which have never been seen before.

"Crypto influencers and companies use ""inflation"" incorrectly. ""Inflation"" has 2 means; the physical meaning and the economic meaning.
- The physical meaning is the increase in size of an object.
- The economic meaning is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency.

Bitcoin will become deflationary (physical term) one day, which means with time total accessible supply of bitcoin will decrease. But this is will be true only when;

```
number of lost bitcoins &gt; number of mined bitcoins
```

We can assume this to be true after 24 years perhaps when mining reward will be too low. But at the current time bitcoin is probably inflationary (physical term).

Bitcoin's inflation (economic term) is a function of demand and supply. It is not a function of its reduced mining rewards because that does not say anything about demand. Whenever the price of bitcoin vs USD drops we can safely say the bitcoin has inflated (economic term). Over a period of last 5 years yes bitcoin has been highly deflationary (economic term). It might continue to be deflationary (economic term) for the next 100 years. Which means Bitcoin might continue to rise in value against USD.

I think no one should fool people to say that Bitcoin is deflationary (economic term) just because of limited supply. Limited supply tell us nothing about the demand. Someone's shitcoin is limited in supply too but they can't surely sell it for an ever increasing price. There has to be demand. People who are not very savvy get pulled into this limited supply shilling to buy shitcoins.

Crypto influencers use the physical and economic meaning of inflation very loosely to fit their narrative. Perhaps they themselves do not know the meaning of inflation which is very dangerous for the community or they are shilling which is bad too.

I think we as a community should get this clarified by the author when this happens. The new Coinbase [article](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-inflation) is an example of confusing usage of inflation.",Bitcoin inflation Vs inflation,2021,1

"There is no need to fear: The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017.

Challenges stimulate progress. Technology, pretty much like life itself, cannot be static. Only dynamics stimulate positive changes. Amid the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in mid-May, many retail and institutional investors began to lose faith in the bright future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. Corporations and institutions, whales, and early adopters converged in a single impulse ‚Äî the internet was overwhelmed by a wave of mistrust towards ‚Äúcryptocurrency number one‚Äù as the best defensive asset, superior to gold and everything else that had been invented prior.

One needs to see the full picture here to realize what‚Äôs happening. The last time the market suffered more or less comparable and significant losses was a year ago, in March 2020. This year, the panic sell-offs caused by a series of negative events ‚Äî Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter crusade against BTC, the rumoured court case against Binance and the latest crackdown on crypto from the Chinese government ‚Äî bring to mind the tremendous collapse of digital assets at the peak of many asset rates in December 2017 and the succeeding ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äù.
However, many people who have little understanding of how the cryptocurrency market functions do not realize the depth of changes that the space has been through in recent years. Emotions are the worst enemy of an investor or trader in a rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. It is worthwhile to look dispassionately at the facts and analyze the changes to understand the true value of ecosystems growing on the fertile soil of the blockchain.The investment mindset has changed in recent years. Even though it continues to be dominated by a highly speculative component, there is also a practical application for the settlement. Investors switched from short-term speculations to the long game. The number of Bitcoin ATMs has doubled since 2020. This dramatic rise clearly demonstrates a growing demand for the world‚Äôs largest crypto assets. From a niche, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.

Stablecoins ‚Äî tokens pegged to their corresponding fiat asset such as the U.S. dollar, euro, etc. ‚Äî have gained significant weight in 2020-2021. With the emergence of new platforms known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols, opportunities appeared to offer profit without risks of the principal asset, for example. Such platforms are nothing more than distributed programs that provide clearing, custody and settlement services. Every year they take a larger piece of the pie from traditional financial institutions. The surge in activity in the environment of decentralized trading platforms also occurred because they do not have the same common vulnerabilities as centralized trading platforms in their infrastructure.

Decentralized exchanges outperform centralized exchanges in terms of trading volume, demonstrating a thousandfold growth in trading volumes in the last year alone. Interfaces for interacting with DeFi can be created by any programmer anywhere globally, and the essence of this interaction is the development of a financial ecosystem running on the global blockchain. By now, DeFi‚Äôs market capitalization has reached over $100 billion, and this trend will undoubtedly continue soon.

Related: The rise of DEX robots: AMMs push for an industrial revolution in trading

Speaking of examples, we can outline that even large companies like Deutsche Telekom have abandoned ‚Äã‚Äãprivate blockchains and are studying public infrastructure, supporting nodes in networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Celo, etc. This fact suggests that the world of decentralized finance is gaining ground in the global market for clearing, custody and settlement services ‚Äî just as Bitcoin had previously secured the status of a shielding asset, removing gold from its throne.

We observe that corporate demand accelerated when real rates on dollar deposits turned negative (central bank rate minus inflation). Inflationary expectations have intensified over the past year, fueling demand for long-term capital preservation. Today, Bitcoin is successfully winning the hearts and minds of not only speculators and hedge funds who, realizing the inevitability of the devaluation of dollar balances, vote with their money and transfer some of the treasury liquidity into digital assets.",The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017,2021,1

"So let's imagine that statewide adoption of Bitcoin continues to spread from Central America and South America until it's the world's reserve currency. What would be the economic effects of a fixed, deflationary currency. Could this create a new form of mercantilism in the modern age? 

For those who don't know what mercantilism was, it was an eighteenth century economic theory centered around the scarcity of wealth (particularly gold). The idea was that because there was only a fixed amount of gold in the world, global trade was a zero sum game. In order to win this game, a nation had to export more than it imported, thus hoarding more gold and having more wealth than other nations. 

So, if Bitcoin is the world's store of wealth and there's only a fixed amount, could you see this causing a revival of mercantilist economic theory? Perhaps states and institutions might start to hoard as much bitcoin as possible and it could lead to extreme economic protectionism, tariffs, and limit free trade?

"Crypto influencers and companies use ""inflation"" incorrectly. ""Inflation"" has 2 means; the physical meaning and the economic meaning.
- The physical meaning is the increase in size of an object.
- The economic meaning is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency.

Bitcoin will become deflationary (physical term) one day, which means with time total accessible supply of bitcoin will decrease. But this is will be true only when;

```
number of lost bitcoins &gt; number of mined bitcoins
```

We can assume this to be true after 24 years perhaps when mining reward will be too low. But at the current time bitcoin is probably inflationary (physical term).

Bitcoin's inflation (economic term) is a function of demand and supply. It is not a function of its reduced mining rewards because that does not say anything about demand. Whenever the price of bitcoin vs USD drops we can safely say the bitcoin has inflated (economic term). Over a period of last 5 years yes bitcoin has been highly deflationary (economic term). It might continue to be deflationary (economic term) for the next 100 years. Which means Bitcoin might continue to rise in value against USD.

I think no one should fool people to say that Bitcoin is deflationary (economic term) just because of limited supply. Limited supply tell us nothing about the demand. Someone's shitcoin is limited in supply too but they can't surely sell it for an ever increasing price. There has to be demand. People who are not very savvy get pulled into this limited supply shilling to buy shitcoins.

Crypto influencers use the physical and economic meaning of inflation very loosely to fit their narrative. Perhaps they themselves do not know the meaning of inflation which is very dangerous for the community or they are shilling which is bad too.

I think we as a community should get this clarified by the author when this happens. The new Coinbase [article](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-inflation) is an example of confusing usage of inflation.",Bitcoin inflation Vs inflation,2021,1

"There is no need to fear: The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017.

Challenges stimulate progress. Technology, pretty much like life itself, cannot be static. Only dynamics stimulate positive changes. Amid the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in mid-May, many retail and institutional investors began to lose faith in the bright future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. Corporations and institutions, whales, and early adopters converged in a single impulse ‚Äî the internet was overwhelmed by a wave of mistrust towards ‚Äúcryptocurrency number one‚Äù as the best defensive asset, superior to gold and everything else that had been invented prior.

One needs to see the full picture here to realize what‚Äôs happening. The last time the market suffered more or less comparable and significant losses was a year ago, in March 2020. This year, the panic sell-offs caused by a series of negative events ‚Äî Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter crusade against BTC, the rumoured court case against Binance and the latest crackdown on crypto from the Chinese government ‚Äî bring to mind the tremendous collapse of digital assets at the peak of many asset rates in December 2017 and the succeeding ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äù.
However, many people who have little understanding of how the cryptocurrency market functions do not realize the depth of changes that the space has been through in recent years. Emotions are the worst enemy of an investor or trader in a rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. It is worthwhile to look dispassionately at the facts and analyze the changes to understand the true value of ecosystems growing on the fertile soil of the blockchain.The investment mindset has changed in recent years. Even though it continues to be dominated by a highly speculative component, there is also a practical application for the settlement. Investors switched from short-term speculations to the long game. The number of Bitcoin ATMs has doubled since 2020. This dramatic rise clearly demonstrates a growing demand for the world‚Äôs largest crypto assets. From a niche, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.

Stablecoins ‚Äî tokens pegged to their corresponding fiat asset such as the U.S. dollar, euro, etc. ‚Äî have gained significant weight in 2020-2021. With the emergence of new platforms known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols, opportunities appeared to offer profit without risks of the principal asset, for example. Such platforms are nothing more than distributed programs that provide clearing, custody and settlement services. Every year they take a larger piece of the pie from traditional financial institutions. The surge in activity in the environment of decentralized trading platforms also occurred because they do not have the same common vulnerabilities as centralized trading platforms in their infrastructure.

Decentralized exchanges outperform centralized exchanges in terms of trading volume, demonstrating a thousandfold growth in trading volumes in the last year alone. Interfaces for interacting with DeFi can be created by any programmer anywhere globally, and the essence of this interaction is the development of a financial ecosystem running on the global blockchain. By now, DeFi‚Äôs market capitalization has reached over $100 billion, and this trend will undoubtedly continue soon.

Related: The rise of DEX robots: AMMs push for an industrial revolution in trading

Speaking of examples, we can outline that even large companies like Deutsche Telekom have abandoned ‚Äã‚Äãprivate blockchains and are studying public infrastructure, supporting nodes in networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Celo, etc. This fact suggests that the world of decentralized finance is gaining ground in the global market for clearing, custody and settlement services ‚Äî just as Bitcoin had previously secured the status of a shielding asset, removing gold from its throne.

We observe that corporate demand accelerated when real rates on dollar deposits turned negative (central bank rate minus inflation). Inflationary expectations have intensified over the past year, fueling demand for long-term capital preservation. Today, Bitcoin is successfully winning the hearts and minds of not only speculators and hedge funds who, realizing the inevitability of the devaluation of dollar balances, vote with their money and transfer some of the treasury liquidity into digital assets.",The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017,2021,1

The final activation will not happen until November but it's now time to be prepared. If you don't upgrade, the old nodes will consider the taproot transactions as ""anyone-can-spend"" so they will continue to work but without validating their correctness.

"So let's imagine that statewide adoption of Bitcoin continues to spread from Central America and South America until it's the world's reserve currency. What would be the economic effects of a fixed, deflationary currency. Could this create a new form of mercantilism in the modern age? 

For those who don't know what mercantilism was, it was an eighteenth century economic theory centered around the scarcity of wealth (particularly gold). The idea was that because there was only a fixed amount of gold in the world, global trade was a zero sum game. In order to win this game, a nation had to export more than it imported, thus hoarding more gold and having more wealth than other nations. 

So, if Bitcoin is the world's store of wealth and there's only a fixed amount, could you see this causing a revival of mercantilist economic theory? Perhaps states and institutions might start to hoard as much bitcoin as possible and it could lead to extreme economic protectionism, tariffs, and limit free trade?

"Earlier this week, Palantir bought 50 million dollars worth of gold bars to prepare for a coming ""black swan event"".

If this was any other company, it wouldn't mean very much to me, but Palantir is not an ordinary company. They are a big data intelligence firm that the United States uses in their military, the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc... While most of the exact uses in government are classified/secret, it is known that their data was responsible for locating Osama Bin Laden that led to the 2011 raid.

They are essentially a worldwide intelligence network that has access to so much data that the rest of the world is not privy to. So when they are prepping for a ""black swan event"", it's because they see something coming that the rest of us don't see. Something in their data is suggesting something is coming, and I think people should be paying attention.","If Palantir is prepping for a Black Swan event, you should probably pay attention.",2021,1

"The unfortunate battle we face is that people don't see what's coming. They aren't equipped to understand what the law of the EU and US can do. People underestimate the sheer technical capabilities and cunning of the state. Worse yet, they fail to realize that these ideologues have a completely different world view. For as much as you seek to avoid censorship, they \*believe\* in the neccessity of it. 

From their perspective, everything is a potential threat to their power, to their narrative, a weed in their garden.

Binance mandated full KYC today. Onlyfans just used the payment rails to threaten the livelihood of god knows how many people. I'm consistently met with blank stares when people realize just how actually censurable they were and how caught in the blue they were by US financial regulations. Consistently people underestimate the capacity to censor payment rails. This was one ideological group, puritans, not even the main one which I will not mention who is \*really\* obsessed with censoring peoples payment rails for wrongthink.

They have a new tool, you may have just seen, being implemented on Bitmex, Deribit, Huobi, and Binance. It's called Veriscope. It's a ""trustless decentralized"" way to comply with the ""Travel Rule"". Well it is basically blockchain Swift. 

""Compliance is an NFT"" If you don't have the layer 2 KYC token, you get financially excluded. Pretty Simple. 

How long until every native wallet in the world gets blacklisted from depositing to full KYC exchanges that does not have this Veriscope thing on it, how long before they start blocking deposits that don't have a full custody chain history of wallets and Vasps with travel rule compliant layer 2 KYC tokens. We always knew this was coming.

Whirlpool can't work on this, nothing that lacks the KYC token can. They're sneaking a gardened ""Fungibility Crisis"" onto us. They're recreating Swift, and global financial exclusion. They want to, it's what they \*believe\*.

Look I hate to say it folks but if you read the writing on the wall, if we don't normalize venues and merchants in person accepting native bitcoin on native wallets in a cash like basis, we run the risk of re-excluding everyone. Cash is king, because you can't do this to it, that's why they want a cashless society. If you want bitcoin to act like cash, it's a cultural war more than anything. 

I firmly believe issues with surveillance orwell antics concerning DeFi and Lightning network in general are going to go strait to the Supreme Court. They will fight us tooth and nail to the bitter end to have the right to use Lightning Network peer to peer payments en masse adoption at the point of payment like cash, and if we lose that, they will have constant surveillance over every payment, and I see no outcome of that other than stranding a huge part of native bitcoin out of the US and EU gardened chain analysis surveillance ridden systems. 

They want you to wake up a criminal. Sure there will be mass disobedience, but ultimately with criminal Banking Secrecy act prosecution and IRS enforcement on payment shops accepting 'unsurveilled lightning payments'..They can ruin peoples lives, businesses, imprison people, intimidate people.

Much rather they would have a CBDC with an expiration date, negative interest rate, and immediate censorship.

Making money on offshore exchanges and DeFi, unlicensed products? Well don't be surprised if they have plans to keep it banned off offramps, they dont' want you to make unsanctioned money that you can actually spend.","Censorship is The Pot, We're the Frog",2021,1

"Hey guys! I have been a crypto enthusiast since mid 2017. I went to a school in the US and graduated with 360k in student loans for my doctorate. 

I averaged in to BTC, ETH, and LTC during 2017 and  started seeing some nice gains. Then I got heavy into altcoins, specifically raiblocks (now Nano). My small investment of about 10k went to 70k very quickly. This was an amazing feeling that only a crypto investor can understand. I was young and about 27. Greed combined with euphoria became a part of me. ""This can't drop and if it does it can't drop much, this is the future!"" I told myself repeatedly.

Sure enough I held through the bear market. God damn was that hard. I lost about 95% of my 70k portfolio in a matter of months. Red day after red day. A constant bloodbath.

I never stopped believing in crypto. Bought more in 2019 and kept adding slowly. Meanwhile I was also aggressively paying down my loan with 4.5k a month and living with my in-laws to save where I could. 

The recent parabolic rise to 65k was amazing. I began to feel the ultimate sign of a potential top, euphoria. I knew this feeling well and experienced it on that New Years Eve of 2017. Things are going great and I have a potentially life changing amount of money.   


I told myself not this time around. I refuse to hold through another bear market, this euphoria is a sign. So I sold it all; about 2 Bitcoin for 120k. With my hard work and aggressive stance on loan payback I paid off my entire loan of 360k in five years and crypto was a huge part of that.

This is a success story and hopefully it can reach someone that needs to hear this when your time comes. I am so sad to not have those bitcoins but when you can change your life make the difficult and mature decision, do it.

Cheers.",Sold all my crypto and paid off a 360k student loan,2021,1

"Pandora Papers:

Terabytes of data, 12.9 million documents, all detailing how billionaires and over 300 corrupt politicians have avoided taxes, and Bitcoin was not used a single time by them.

How can it be that exactly the politicians who claim that crypto would be the main accelerator of financial crime and tax evasion have used exclusively the broken old financial system to do that which they blame crypto on supporting.

With Bitcoin every single transaction would be transparent on the blockchain, everyone could see where all the money is going. Wondering why they are so against it? The reason seems more obvious than ever.

Pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.

The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or ""offshore"".

These offshore countries or territories are where:

\- it's easy to set up companies

\- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies

\- there is low or no corporation tax.

The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.

Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.

To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.

When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.

This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.

Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.","In the over 12,9 Million Documents and Terabytes of Data detailing how Billionaires and Politicians have avoided Taxes, Bitcoin is not used a Single Time.",2021,1

It's human nature that you don't want to depend on external factors and use something you can't control. The US can print the dollars to infinity and export it as it's product to all other nations (with little to no consequences on its domestic economy). Before 1971 all was fine, as USD was a gold certificate. Nixon temporarily suspended that convertibility, and now, over 50 years from that event, we are still in fiat. What is the impact of this? Countries have to suck it up, deal with it, and use US dollar. Since 1971 this setup always had a negative impact on their economy. Now everything might change.

This fund is being established by the founder/CEO of NZs largest crypto platform Easycrypto.

The founder was working for NZs second largest bank as their Corporate Strategy Manager when they registered Easycrypto with the NZ companies Office.

Nine months after establishing Easycrypto the Founder/CEO moved to work in an executive strategic role for NZs national airline AirNZ where a former PM of NZ and current chairman of the largest NZ bank (US majority shareholder owned) is a board member. The ex PM and chairman of NZs largest bank was very fond of the AirNZ CEO and nominated him to be the National parties Next leader and so subsequently the CEO Christopher Luxon was elected to parliament and is biding his time to take leadership of the now opposition National party. The National party is known for its close relationship with the US owned banks that dominate the NZ banking sector.

Anyway now this close associate of both of NZs largest banks not only operates the largest crypto platform but is also opening a investment vehicle designed to attract investors to Bitcoin by holding the custody of the Bitcoin in foreign funds.

This type of fund argues that many people don't want the trouble of holding their own Bitcoin and dealing with the tax complications and so they will hold the Bitcoin for you while charging an annual 2.5% fee. They hope to do a deal with the NZ government tax department allowing the fund members to be only taxed on an assumed and fixed rate of return of 5% instead of taxation on actual gains or losses...although the NZ IRD does not appear to have yet agreed to this deal.

This looks like the commodification of Bitcoin by bankers.

They offer the government a secure tax stream and themselves a secure income while the investors take all the risk but hold no real custody or control over the Bitcoin.

Such funds could be designed to move toward a scenario where Bitcoin can only be held by such institutional custodians and not held directly by citizens- this is of course a complete undermining and subversion of the entire Bitcoin ethos and values.

The bankers cartel are afraid of Bitcoin because its superior integrity is attracting more and more citizens to move their savings from fiat shitcoin to Bitcoin integrity.

Their corporate strategy managers are looking for all and every way they can capture and control and ultimately neuter Bitcoin.

I hope they fail as enough of us are aware of their intentions and will never surrender our coins and hopes of change to their corrupt rentseeking custody!",NZ's first bitcoin-only investment fund launched,2021,1

**I've deposited 10,000 sats into a wallet. You get to guess the seed phrase.**

To make it even easier, **I'm going to give you ALL of the words.**

That's right, I'm literally going to give you ALL of the seed words, in random order, for your guessing pleasure.

**Here they are:**

All 24 of them right there.

You've even got the zpub there to see all addresses for the wallet.

I'm not shitting you. The words are there. The free BTC is there.

Just go and get it right? RIGHT?

\--------------------------------------------------

**Now, if you want to find out why you're going to fail miserably at this, keep reading...**

Why is it near (and I mean neeeaaarrr) impossible for someone to be randomly assigned your words, or to be guessed by somebody else?

To find out, let's start with a worst case scenario, a head start if you will: **Somebody knows all of your 24 words, but not the exact order of them.**

You might think that's an INSANE advantage right? Let's see...

To find out how many ways you can order 24 words, we can use a factorial. A factorial is simply multiplying a number by all of the numbers below it, denoted by a ""!"" after the number.

4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

So what's the factorial of 24?...

24! = 24 x 23 x 22 x 21... = **~620,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.**

That is **620 sextillion unique ways to order 24 words.**

To put that into perspective, the average high end gaming computer has a clock speed of 4GHz, meaning it can make 4 billion calculations per second.

620 sextillion / 4 billion = 155 trillion seconds.

155 trillion seconds / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 = **4,915,017 years to find all permutations using a modern gaming PC.**

Unless they've got a quantum super-computer, nobody will simply guess, stumble upon, or brute force your seed phrase. **And this is knowing ALL of the words to begin with.**

Hell, even *with* a super computer it‚Äôll still take years to find.

If you don't know every single word for the phrase, go ahead and **multiply that number by 2,048!**.

Those are the REAL odds you have to worry about.

**TL;DR: You're screwed. Bwahahahahahahahahaha**","Think somebody can guess or accidentally get your seed phrase? Nope, and I‚Äôll prove it with free money.",2021,1

"From: [https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html](https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html)

They seem harmless enough, 52 thin slices of laminated cardboard with  colorful designs printed on their sides.  Yet, as another illustration  of the mantra that complexity begins from the most simple systems, the  number of variations that these 52 cards can produce is virtually  endless.  The richness of most playing card games owes itself to this  fact.

The number of possible permutations of 52 cards is 52!.  I think the  exclamation mark was chosen as the symbol for the factorial operator to  highlight the fact that this function produces surprisingly large  numbers in a very short time.  If you have an old school pocket  calculator, the kind that maxes out at 99,999,999, an attempt to  calculate the factorial of any number greater than 11 results only in  the none too helpful value of ""Error"".  So if 12! will break a typical  calculator, how large is 52!?

52! is the number of different ways you can arrange a single deck of  cards.  You can visualize this by constructing a randomly generated  shuffle of the deck.  Start with all the cards in one pile.  Randomly  select one of the 52 cards to be in position 1.  Next, randomly select  one of the remaining 51 cards for position 2, then one of the remaining  50 for position 3, and so on.  Hence, the total number of ways you could  arrange the cards is 52 \* 51 \* 50 \* ... \* 3 \* 2 \* 1, or 52!.  Here's  what that looks like:

80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000

This number is beyond astronomically large.  I say beyond astronomically  large because most numbers that we already consider to be  astronomically large are mere infinitesmal fractions of this number.   So, just how large is it?  Let's try to wrap our puny human brains  around the magnitude of this number with a fun little theoretical  exercise.  Start a timer that will count down the number of seconds from  52! to 0.  We're going to see how much fun we can have before the timer  counts down all the way.

**Start by picking your favorite spot on the equator.  You're going to  walk around the world along the equator, but take a very leisurely pace  of one step every billion years.  Make sure to pack a deck of playing cards, so you can get in a few  trillion hands of solitaire between steps.  After you complete your  round the world trip, remove one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean.   Now do the same thing again:  walk around the world at one billion years  per step, removing one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean each time  you circle the globe.**

**Continue until the ocean is empty.  When it is, take one sheet of  paper and place it flat on the ground.  Now, fill the ocean back up and  start the entire process all over again, adding a sheet of paper to the  stack each time you‚Äôve emptied the ocean.**

**Do this until the stack of paper reaches from the Earth to the Sun.   Take a glance at the timer, you will see that the three left-most digits  haven‚Äôt even changed.  You still have 8.063e67 more seconds to go.     So, take the stack of papers down and do it all over again.  One  thousand times more.   Unfortunately, that still won‚Äôt do it.  There are  still more than 5.385e67 seconds remaining.  You‚Äôre just about a third  of the way done.**

**To pass the remaining time, start shuffling your deck of cards.  Every  billion years deal yourself a 5-card poker hand.  Each time you get a  royal flush, buy yourself a lottery ticket.  If that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand into the Grand  Canyon.  Keep going and when you‚Äôve filled up the canyon with sand,  remove one ounce of rock from Mt. Everest.  Now empty the canyon and  start all over again.  When you‚Äôve levelled Mt. Everest, look at the  timer, you still have 5.364e67 seconds remaining.    You barely made a dent.  If you were to repeat this 255 times, you would  still be looking at 3.024e64 seconds.  The timer would finally reach  zero sometime during your 256th attempt.  Of course, in reality none of this could ever happen.  Sorry to break it  to you.  The truth is, the Pacific Ocean will boil off as the Sun  becomes a red giant before you could even take your fifth step in your  first trek around the world.  Somewhat more of an obstacle, however, is  the fact that all the stars in the universe will eventually burn out  leaving space a dark, ever-expanding void inhabited by a few scattered  elementary particles drifting a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute  zero.  The exact details are still a bit fuzzy, but according to some  reckonings of The Reckoning, all this could happen before you would've  had a chance to reduce the vast Pacific by the amount of a few backyard  swimming pools.**","To further cement u/PizzaOnTheRoof556's point about the odds of correctly guessing his seed phrase (1 in 2048!), here's a puny 52!, for scale.",2021,1

"My bank‚Äôs Director called me yesterday (never talked or met him before).
He told me they were doing some security checks and some ‚Äúanomalies‚Äùpopped up on my account. They noticed I was regularly moving my monthly income into exchanges and the director wanted to warn me about the risks and volatility or cryptos which btw i‚Äôm fully aware of.
He wanted to make sure that I wasn‚Äôt investing debt in crypto which of course i‚Äôm not (I‚Äôm not that dumb) I only invest my hard earned money and what I‚Äôm willing to lose. Im totally debt free and i owe nothing to my bank.
So I asked him what he knew about cryptocurrencies in general. He said : ‚ÄúI heard Elon mask bought a lot of it‚Äù.

I‚Äôm from a small city in Italy (so please apologize my english) and I was not expecting to the Director of my bank to know much about crypto but also not that little.
He kindly asked me not to bring back the money all at once and I simply told him that i have no intention to do so and that i‚Äôm crypto for the long run and not for speculation. I also told him that I was aware of the capital gain tax in case of withdrawals.
He asked some fairly personal financial questions and even though we didn‚Äôt speak about numbers I knew he knew because he told me that he could see my money transfers to exchanges which I didn‚Äôt really like. On the other hand, i had the opportunity to ask him some questions and discovered that I am the only one in that particular bank that is involved with cryptocurrencies

I‚Äôm sharing this story with you because I found very interesting that my bank noticed me. I am your average 28 yo guy with an average job and an average salary.

"I saw someone posting here earlier today about what to do if BTC gets to some high value and they want to sell some. Most of the responses were straight up uninformed and silly dogshit.

You can look at my post history - I sold in 2017, on Coinbase, and moved 100% of the money (1.6M after I dumped my BCH) into my Bank of America account.

1. My account was not frozen
2. My account was not closed
3. Nothing happened except they wanted me to open a brokerage account with them
4. I asked before I moved the money what to expect. They said ""did you get the money illegally? Because that's all we care about.""

So any of these gloom-and-doom edgelord crypton00bs who think the FBI is crawling around looking for people who make 10k on bitcoin and try to cashout are just full of it. 

Don't want trouble? Pay your taxes and ride off into the sunset. Want to get ripped off by shady mofos? Sneak around and try to use some sketch-ass exchange for $200 at a time over several months and hope they don't freeze your account for ""reasons"".

"I'm just a normal guy who tought i was invincible. Now i realized i'm not. 

I started trading 3 months ago at Deribit, depositing around 800 bucks, a small part of my emergence savings. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $7000 when it started to rise. I longed back then, low leverage, tight stop loss and then it reached $10k. Wow, i had a huge 110% ROE. Amazing. Then i saw it getting really difficult to break the $10k zone, so i went short. I waited for 3 weeks and made huge profit when it finally reached its bottom and i finally got my first whole Bitcoin ever!!! Amazing!

Well, i was sure it was the bottom, so i longed again and waited. Well, i hit the sky when i was now in front of a dozen bitcoins 4 weeks later. And then i just increased my position. I was pretty sure it was on its road to $10k, $20k, $50k (i tought ""hey man, this s2f sh\*t really works!"")... so it started to fall this week, just like my balance, and i was highly leveraged to the neck, with an underwater position. My heart started to kill me (this shit really hurts). Then the price rose again today and i started to feel relief. Increased my position, and my profits where getting higher like never! I finally hit $100k of balance in my trading account! 

""OMFG!!! I will finaly get rid of this student loan debt i'm so regretful!!!""

And then the price fell again after weekly close. Didn't had time to close my position manually at Deribit, since it started to become unavailable, and i neglected the risk management enough to reduce my position gradually. Well, the rest of the story you guys know. My heart was aching again, i became deaf for some seconds, and then reality just slapped my face with such strength i will never forget. I'm broke again.",Just lost $100k today,2020,1

How would the economy look and which direction would it go if the government/banks did not have the ability to print money? There are reasons to do it apparently and if the government does not have enough reserves in a Bitcoin economy, how would it handle an economic crisis?

"Most people I talk to throughout the day have zero clue about Bitcoin divisibility. I've even had people assume you have to trade entire Coin as payment. 

It is blowing my mind at how little is actually known about it. 

For example, my grandpa is invested in Bitcoin. But it's through grayscale. He was pitched it by a trusted advisor who's guided his retirement thus far; so no complaints. My grandpa had zero clue that the underlying asset has a minimal storage cost; as well as the ability to send fractions of it at the snap of a finger.

I showed him how to download Green wallet on his iPhone and sent him 50,000 Satoshi. Explained the divisibility, explained the proof of work concept that makes (essentially) every transaction older than 6 confirmations ""immutable.""

"I saw someone posting here earlier today about what to do if BTC gets to some high value and they want to sell some. Most of the responses were straight up uninformed and silly dogshit.

You can look at my post history - I sold in 2017, on Coinbase, and moved 100% of the money (1.6M after I dumped my BCH) into my Bank of America account.

1. My account was not frozen
2. My account was not closed
3. Nothing happened except they wanted me to open a brokerage account with them
4. I asked before I moved the money what to expect. They said ""did you get the money illegally? Because that's all we care about.""

So any of these gloom-and-doom edgelord crypton00bs who think the FBI is crawling around looking for people who make 10k on bitcoin and try to cashout are just full of it. 

Don't want trouble? Pay your taxes and ride off into the sunset. Want to get ripped off by shady mofos? Sneak around and try to use some sketch-ass exchange for $200 at a time over several months and hope they don't freeze your account for ""reasons"". 

Hope this helps. Normally I just stay quiet, but the misinformation on this was so huge and stupid, I had to chime in.

"I'm just a normal guy who tought i was invincible. Now i realized i'm not. 

I started trading 3 months ago at Deribit, depositing around 800 bucks, a small part of my emergence savings. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $7000 when it started to rise. I longed back then, low leverage, tight stop loss and then it reached $10k. Wow, i had a huge 110% ROE. Amazing. Then i saw it getting really difficult to break the $10k zone, so i went short. I waited for 3 weeks and made huge profit when it finally reached its bottom and i finally got my first whole Bitcoin ever!!! Amazing!

Well, i was sure it was the bottom, so i longed again and waited. Well, i hit the sky when i was now in front of a dozen bitcoins 4 weeks later. And then i just increased my position. I was pretty sure it was on its road to $10k, $20k, $50k (i tought ""hey man, this s2f sh\*t really works!"")... so it started to fall this week, just like my balance, and i was highly leveraged to the neck, with an underwater position. My heart started to kill me (this shit really hurts). Then the price rose again today and i started to feel relief. Increased my position, and my profits where getting higher like never! I finally hit $100k of balance in my trading account! 

""OMFG!!! I will finaly get rid of this student loan debt i'm so regretful!!!""

And then the price fell again after weekly close. Didn't had time to close my position manually at Deribit, since it started to become unavailable, and i neglected the risk management enough to reduce my position gradually. Well, the rest of the story you guys know. My heart was aching again, i became deaf for some seconds, and then reality just slapped my face with such strength i will never forget.

How would the economy look and which direction would it go if the government/banks did not have the ability to print money? There are reasons to do it apparently and if the government does not have enough reserves in a Bitcoin economy, how would it handle an economic crisis?

What will shutting down stablecoins do?

It will show that any centralized asset backed crypto is a non-starter (sorry to all the gold bugs with dreams of gold backed crypto). It will show the world that bitcoins decentralized model is the only way the world can have a sound digital currency.

"I am pretty sure this kind of ‚Äúquestion‚Äù has been asked and answered many times. If you know a good thread that discussed this, please direct me there:

I am fully aware of the complete infeasibility of an adversary to have a brute force strategy to search the key space for existing private keys. The odds of hitting a collision are infinitesimal.
Yet they are not zero, especially with several hot wallets just using 12-word mnemonics. So assuming we have large adoption of crypto in 25 years and thousands of dedicated machines run 24/7 just probing random mnemonics they might eventually out of infinitesimal luck hit upon one single existing key. What if this is your wallet holding all your crypto savings? Is this just a risk you need to take when using crypto?

"I posted two posts before about fees and the overall sentiment seemed to be that Lightning is the remedy.

I got a lot of good information and links from you guys so I wanted to follow up with our experience.

We implemented Strike as the provider ( [https://strike.acinq.co/](https://strike.acinq.co/) ) which was one of the recommend ones. Once implemented we have tested deposits using Wallet of Satoshi (iOS) and Phoenix Wallet (Android).

Strike API had good documentation and was really simple to implement. Their dashboard tools are basic but does the job. Integration took about 4-5 hours in total which is pretty decent. We had no issues, everything worked as advertised.

Using WoS or Phoenix Wallet was super simple as well. Install, create new wallet, put some funds in it and your ready. We had some casual Bitcoin users try it out and they had no problems getting started.

The performance really blew our minds. Instant deposits with virtually zero fees. Which we knew, but how simple it was and actually seeing the funds arrive almost instantly was just awesome to see.

Withdrawals are still not using Lightning but will use regular transactions for now so we have not solved that part. But allowing for easy payments in is a good first step.

This is truly looking like the next step for Bitcoin as a proper payment solution.

"Introduction

Last week's I have been using Sphinx, this app run on top of LN and use TLV to send messages on top of LN. That does it means that every message is a payment sent from one user to another. That also means that every message need a micro payment that guarantee that nodes route your messages. But if you use the oficial servers you aren't charged because the sats never leave their nodes, of course you can connect the app to your own node. 

Being told that the app is at beta stage and the Android version lack some features, but the devs are working hard to fix everything.

Features

The app support sending and requesting payments, you can send satoshis to your contacts directly and they can request satoshis from your. Also support paid images and paid messages. You post and image and set a price, the user pay and got the image or message. 

And the latest addition have been groups, just like telegram or Whatsapp but since it built on top of LN you can create paid groups. Yes, you can set a price to join to your group and also can charge an amount per message. 100 satoshis to join my group and every message cost 1 satoshi. 

You can check the current group at tribes.sphinx.chat and scan the QR code and join that group. 

The app is a wallet too!! You can pay from it. 

That is basically sphinx, probably the most exciting thing built on top of LN in my opinion. Feel free to join, sell memes and report bugs. 

Ps: at sphinx.chat you can find the telegram group

BTC Friends,

Let‚Äôs be honest, Bitcoin is confusing. Not to you (you are on this /r/ after all), but to the people who have no idea what it is. Trying to explain Bitcoin is even harder. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all had those long, complicated, drawn-out conversations which leave people more confused than when it started. 

To aid its adoption **WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AT EXPLAINING WHAT BITCOIN IS.** 

Here are a few tips that should, hopefully, help you manage a simple and easy to understand discussion about Bitcoin. 

Before we get to that, a few things to remember:

**Bitcoin is a** ***fundamental*** **change from what most people believe.** An explanation about Bitcoin shouldn‚Äôt be about ‚Äúbeing right‚Äù or ‚Äúwinning the argument.‚Äù Instead, it should be about helping someone explore a new idea and begin to understand that there are actually different alternatives to the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù they‚Äôve ever known.

**Bitcoin is complicated.** It‚Äôs important to remember that this is as much of an emotion transformation for someone as it is a logical one. A CONFUSED MIND ALWAYS SAYS NO. If you leave a person confused or frustrated about what Bitcoin is, they are more likely to build up a resistance to it and become close-minded because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just too complicated.‚Äù

**Adoption is a marathon, not a sprint.** Don‚Äôt feel the need to word vomit all of your intense 1337 cypto-knowledge in a single conversation. Slow and steady. Like a good story-teller, keep them wanting more. 

Now, some tips to consider:

**1. Start with ‚ÄòWHAT is Bitcoin?,‚Äô not ‚ÄòWHY is Bitcoin?‚Äô**

A fundamental mistake that people make is to try to justify WHY something exists before even explaining WHAT something is. Your explanations need to act as a building blocks of knowledge which means you have to have a very clear, very easily understood, fundamental premise:

*Bitcoin is‚Ä¶:*

*Digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet.* 

*An alternative form of money than what you are given by your local government.* 

That's it. That's Bitcoin. While I‚Äôm sure we can, and probably will, argue about what that base, fundamental definition is, it‚Äôs important to start with WHAT, not WHY. 

While hyperinflation, store of value, scarcity, the Federal Reserve, and how the printing of fiat devalues currency are all important, it does not answer the question of WHAT is Bitcoin. If you start with WHY, you are skipping a major building block in the mind of the listener and are on your way to creating confusion. And remember, a confused mind always says no!

Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7l4A5DSYas). (Now, don‚Äôt go full-internet on me. I‚Äôm not degrading this person or this video THANK YOU PERSON FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO. This video is awesome! I only bring it up because it is a recent video that got some attention. It also demonstrates this point.)

When asked to explain Bitcoin, here is the opening line:

‚ÄúThe FED‚Ä¶is out of control with printing money‚Ä¶‚Äù

This is a ‚ÄòWHY is Bitcoin‚Äô response. Already, the listener is probably thinking, ‚Äòwhat the heck does the FED have to do with anything? I just wanted to know what Bitcoin was‚Ä¶‚Äô and you may just lose your listener right there. 

Furthermore, this video never actually says ‚ÄúBitcoin IS‚Ä¶‚Äù While there is an implied comparison to gold, there is never a fundamental definition of WHAT Bitcoin is. 

Start with a clear, concise definition of WHAT Bitcoin is before moving on to WHY Bitcoin is. 

**2. Let Them Lead / Gauge Their Interest / Know When To Stop**

When explaining any topic to someone who doesn‚Äôt understand it, there is a very strong temptation to TELL everything you know. This is human nature. We are proud of what we know. We want to display knowledge and proficiency. We must, however, understand that it is counter-productive to the learning process. Imagine that certain math teacher going over that certain math problem. They explain it. They are enthusiastic about it. They write it on the chalkboard. Yet your eyes glaze over. It‚Äôs too much too fast. You are just waiting until the end when they finally tell you the answer. All logic and reasoning and understanding is gone. This is similar. 

Instead of telling them everything you know, **LET THEM ASK!** Allowing your listener to ASK demonstrates two things: an *understanding* of the last thing you said and, more importantly, *interest!* Ultimately, that‚Äôs what we want and need; their interest.

Believe me, just like that little kid asking, ‚Äòwhy, why, why‚Ä¶?‚Äô They will give you every opportunity to share a little bit more, and a little bit more.

For example:

Bitcoiner ‚Äì ‚Äú*Bitcoin are digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet.‚Äù* 

(STOP TALKING AND LEAVE SPACE FOR THEM TO ASK!!!)

Noob ‚Äì *‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ok‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶why do we need that? What's wrong with the money I have now?‚Äù*

Bitcoiner ‚Äì *‚ÄúWell, there is a risk that, over time, the money that you keep in your wallet or bank account will actually be worth less and be able to buy less stuff.‚Äù*

(STOP TALKING AND LEAVE SPACE FOR THEM TO ASK!!!)

Noob ‚Äì *‚ÄúWait, what do you mean?‚Äù*

And we are now on our way to a discussion about these messy and intense concepts of inflation vs deflation, printing of fiat currency, fractional reserve lending, etc. And through it all, **LET THEM LEAD**. 

Now this is the tough part. If their eyes glaze over, **YOU HAVE TO STOP!** When the questions stop, **YOU HAVE TO STOP!** The last thing you want to do is ramble on once they‚Äôve stopped listening. Instead, ASK them a question:

‚Äú*I‚Äôm sorry, did you not understand something I said?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDid I answer your question?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúIs this interesting to you?‚Äù*

By doing this, you will give them an opportunity to ASK you another question: *‚Äú‚Ä¶back up‚Ä¶what did you mean when you said ‚Äòstore of value‚Äô?‚Äù*

Or maybe even make a comment: *‚Äú‚Ä¶wow‚Ä¶this stuff is pretty complicated‚Ä¶‚Äù*

In either case, this actually helps keep the conversation going. Just back up, explain it again, keeping in mind your base concepts and definitions, and see if you can talk them past where they got stuck. 

Maybe they shut you down entirely: *‚Äúyou know what, this is crazy, it can‚Äôt be true, let‚Äôs change the subject‚Ä¶‚Äù* To which the ONLY correct response is, *‚ÄúOk!‚Äù* (we‚Äôll get to this later). 

Keep in mind that letting your listener lead will allow you to carry the conversation much further than you trying to push it along on your own. 

**3. Know Your Role / A Little at a Time / Don‚Äôt Overcorrect** 

So, what‚Äôs the end goal? Is it to have them whip out their phone, download an exchange, and make their first Bitcoin purchase right then and there?! No, of course not. 

The role of these conversations is to **LEAVE THEM WANTING MORE.** Your goal should be to spark *interest* and *curiosity*. If after talking with you they end up on The Google or The YouTube looking for more information, then *you‚Äôve done your part!* 

Movies and TV condition us to want the big payoff at the end: the parade, the teary embrace, the triumphant symphony. That is not real life. Really, the best ending to a Bitcoin conversation might just be your listener making an audible, but clearly deeply contemplative, ‚Äú‚Ä¶huh‚Ä¶‚Äù. You‚Äôve done your job. You‚Äôve got them noodling something they have never noodled before. 

Even once you understand Bitcoin, there is still an entirely different conversation about what the technology is, how it works, and how people interact with it. And let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs complex and confusing. Exchanges, blockchain, forks, difficulty adjustments, miners, cold storage‚Ä¶ More complicated ideas. More jargon. Make sure you throttle yourself back and explain just **A LITTLE AT A TIME.** It‚Äôs ok to have one conversation about the fundamentals of Bitcoin and then an entirely different conversation about blockchain technology or how people acquire BTC or the difference between storing Bitcoin on an exchange versus a cold wallet. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you have to tackle all of this at once.

While all this is happening, **BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERCORRECT.** People know what they know, right? And what people know is always correct, right?? Be sensitive. If your listener makes a comment that isn‚Äôt true or is off track, don‚Äôt scold them or forcefully correct them. **If your listener feels attacked or threatened, conflict will arise, and once that happens, their minds will be completely shut off.** No one listens during an argument. Don‚Äôt attack. Explain.

For example:

Noob ‚Äì *‚ÄúWell, the USD is backed by gold, so that will prevent it from ever devaluing!‚Äù*

Bitcoiner ‚Äì *‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs pretty interesting, a lot of people think the same thing. The truth is that while the USD was backed by gold for a long period of time, it isn‚Äôt anymore. You see, back in 1971‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Keep it simple, factual, and non-confrontational.

Going back to our example from before, even if your listener shuts you down entirely, **THAT‚ÄôS OK!** They have now experienced a Bitcoin conversation that will percolate around in their brain. And perhaps next time they hear the word Bitcoin, whether on the news or on the internet, they‚Äôll think back to your conversation and what you shared with them. Hopefully you didn‚Äôt over-press and their memory of your conversation isn't a negative one which leaves them feeling negative about Bitcoin: *‚ÄúBitcoin is stupid and people who believe in Bitcoin are arrogant and rude.‚Äù*

Finally, **ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH.** The journey doesn‚Äôt start and end with you. You are simply a stepping stone along their path. Know that you are playing a part in their story; you are not the main character. 

Adoption of Bitcoin will occur over a long period of time. The conversations we have with our friends and family will create the buzz, attention, and understanding that is needed, but please be mindful that you are doing it in a helpful and productive way that leaves people wanting to know more.

Background: 28 year old with no financial obligations (no house, wife, kids etc). Have a stable job working for a Hedge Fund in London.

The way I see Bitcoin is essentially an asymmetric risk/reward bet. There‚Äôs a possibility it doesn‚Äôt take off from the $10k mark and the price falls indefinitely (for various reasons which we all know).

On the flip side we have a number of bullish signals which could realistically 10x the price over the next 5 years.

My argument is - with house and equity prices at all time highs, what is my best bet to maximise my income for the future? A provably scarce hard asset that has an enormous network effect and the possibility to grow into a multi trillion market seems like a sensible option.

If it all goes wrong then I will cry myself to sleep for a few days and just re-earn it all back in about 2 years.

"For the last few years I loved both gold and Bitcoin although I had much more of my net-worth in gold. After MUCH thought, I've decided I will be soon liquidating my gold and buying more Bitcoin. Here's why:

\*

I believe after this whole COVID shitshow is said and done FIAT currencies are going to be fucked and all governments are going to realize that they MUST back their currency by some sort of reserve asset. We really only have 3 options - Gold/Silver, Oil, and Bitcoin. Let's just disregard Oil because we all know oil is slowly on it's way out. With the way China is hoarding gold, I believe China will back it's new central bank digital currency by gold reserves. The whole world will start rethinking using the US Dollar backed by NOTHING (you can say army, but that's not going to work for long). The US isn't going to copy China and back their currency by Gold again imo, so I honestly think they'll choose Bitcoin (although I could easily be wrong).

\*

Anyways both Gold and Bitcoin are a good bet against FIAT currencies, the only problem is that when gold prices go up (demand goes up), a shitload more miners start mining gold and the price of Gold eventually comes back down to it's cost of production (and usually overshoots it to the downside due to human psychology). If gold becomes a reserve asset, governments will see these miners going out of business and subsidize them, which artificially decreased the cost of production, further decreasing the price of gold. Miners are NOT the friends of gold investors, they are the ""enemy.""

\*

Since only 900 Bitcoin are mined per day (currently 6.25 per block), if miners doubled network's hashrate tomorrow, the supply would remain the same. THIS IS HUGE. Miners are securing the network, which adds utility to Bitcoin. When utility is added, the intrinsic value of Bitcoin goes up, which causes a positive feedback loop for price. Miners are the FRIENDS of investors. This is a MASSIVE fundamental difference, not even taking into account the 21 million supply max vs. gold's infinite supply, the additional ease of transportation, digital utility, etc.

\*

If Bitcoin and Gold both become reserve assets, do I believe the Chinese government that they have the exact amount of gold in reserves as digitally-printed money? We have the ""trust"" that they're telling the public the truth. With Bitcoin, governments can provably verify their reserves and we don't have to ""trust"" them, anyone in the world can verify it for themselves. This is fundamentally superior in a world where lies are everywhere, at least you know your currency is sound.",I'm selling my GOLD for Bitcoin. Here's why,2020,1

"A lot of people seem to be pumping the idea that Bitcoin will have a sharp increase in price from this last halving, like it did after the previous 2 times.

But it seems there are 2 things that would make each successive halving have less of an impact on Bitcoin:


1: As time passes more Bitcoin are mined, and so the amount of Bitcoin that comes from the ‚Äúblock reward‚Äù has less of an inpact on the overall supply.

2: Because each halving is a halving of the last halving, the reduction in block reward is smaller in absolute terms.

I've known about btc for quite a while, somewhere around 2012 my buddy used to mine it and I thought oh thats cool and moved on.  Flash forward years later I watched what happened in 2017 and started doing research.  When it crashed from 2017s peak I wanted to buy some so bad, but I have been poor literally my entire adult life.  I started working in social work in my early 20s, specifically in rehabs and addiction treatment centers.  I worked in ethical ones and never was able to really pull ahead financially.  Anyways, I landed a good job in 2019 after years of grinding and around the same time stumbled into a small sum of money (literally massive amount to me but small comparitively.)  I started researching btc again because the gains caught my eye but the tech and ideology made a believer out of me.  Anyways covid hit and btc dumped to around 4k and I committed as big as I could.  I had to cash some out recently (don't trip im still holding id never sell it all lol) to buy my girlfriend of five years a ring.  We've been together almost five years and has had my back on everything thick and thin.  She used to help me out when I didn't have enough to pay the bills, and thanks to bitcoin I was finally able to afford to give her a ring that she absolutely loves.  On top of that, btc has also given me the ability to buy that ring, and still be financially stable!

As heading says, which is the best hardware wallet? I want to get a hardware wallet for me which suits the best, so I need your help. Please! I've been knowing about Ledger Nano S so is it the only Best hardware wallet? 

Here are something about the different hardware wallets I know, please correct me if I am wrong -

1. Ledger Nano X - a bit costly for me, and have been hearing that it is being hacked most of the times.

2. Ledger Nano S - budget friendly, however have been hearing that it is not much secure. Also it isn't mobile friendly 

3. Safepal S1 - fits all my needs, is budget friendly (40$), has connection with Mobile, supports all crypto, but it is from **China and I don't think Chinese marketplace is good. Also, I don't know how secure is this? Please I need help with this one**

4. Coldcard - hmm, I didn't like it Structure. Also is a bit costly for me.

5. Trezor - have been hearing that it can be hacked

6. Secux - is good but don't know how secure it is.


**Please this is my opinion on various hardware wallets. I need your help, and I have never ordered anything from outside so I also don't know how it will arrive. I am from Nepal so also don't know if they will be able to reach to my country. I don't have credit card so I can use only crypto to pay them. Please help me. And if it is under 60$ I can happily buy it, if it's not I'll still try to buy it. I also don't know about VAT and taxes. If there are other hardware wallets, please tell me that** or if there is a website or a doc which compares all the wallets, it will be good for me.

Having done some research it looks like the Ledger isn‚Äôt the only option and I‚Äôve read a lot about the Coldcard which looks pretty cool.
I see a lot of people saying that ledger isn‚Äôt actually all that secure and that coldcard is the best option but it depends on your needs.

" Some cryptocurrency custody services like Bitgo allow users to make wallets. Introducing this feature to regular users, not institutional ones, questions the self-control nature of the cryptocurrency world, so my story begins here.

I am using Bitgo to store my bitcoins since 2017 until I noticed my account is closed by Bitgo (actually frozen for 40 years) without any prior explanation. When I tried to contact their support, they closed every single ticket with no reply. So I decided to get back into the file they gave me when I registered first and opened wallet. I had ensured company reputation and wallet explanation during register that backup given file could recover my savings but I was Wrong.

After trying to use Bitgo [recovery tools](https://github.com/BitGo/wallet-recovery-wizard/releases/download/v2.6.5/BitGoWalletRecoveryWizard.Setup.2.6.5.exe) with the given backup file, It did not work out so I decided to read more about their protocols and figure out how this service works. So I found that they are using MultiSig with 2 of 3 threshold need to open the wallet. Keys were split between me, Bitgo and a KRS (Key recovery service) called Keyternal. This was not what I registered for and they were not mentioned any KRS back then so I thought I own bitcoins just by carrying the file. Anyway, I have my own key and need to get it signed by Bitgo or Keyternal. Bitgo is not even answering emails or tickets and Keyternal has not done anything in past 3 weeks. So I'm stuck between these two companies trying to get out my assets, though Keyternal does not look like a proper company (you can tell it from viewing their [website](https://keytern.al/)).

My final advice to you is to not use Bitgo AT ALL. They make you feel you have full access to your wallet and one day you become aware of the BIG MISTAKE you made.",Do not use Bitgo AT ALL!,2020,1

"I was introduced to Modern Monetary Theory through Stephanie Kelton‚Äôs book - The Deficit Myth

The central tenant of MMT is that as a Monetary Sovereign currency issuer, the US government can print as much money as it wants so we shouldn‚Äôt worry about running up large national debts/deficits. 

We‚Äôve seen this play out recently with the multi-trillion dollar stimulus plans and the proposed multi-trillion dollar climate plans - there‚Äôs no plan for paying back any of that money or any conversations about lowering the national debt/deficit. 

This likely means low interest rates (nearly zero in the US and negative interest rates in Europe) for quite a while.

This means that to effectively retire people cannot rely on traditional safe financial instruments like bonds / savings accounts. Instead needing to become proficient asset allocators (or needing hire someone to manage asset allocation for them). Adding this complexity to the system will be a problem for low information investors. 

That‚Äôs where Bitcoin comes in. As a store of value Bitcoin can replace the traditional savings account that yielded between 5 and 20(!!) percent during most of the late 1900s (when interest rates were higher spending was more controlled). 

TL;DR - MMT is a reality and has destroyed USD as store of value, Bitcoin fixes this

This is a MASSIVE fundamental difference, not even taking into account the 21 million supply max vs. gold's infinite supply, the additional ease of transportation, digital utility, etc.

We have the ""trust"" that they're telling the public the truth.

"A lot of people seem to be pumping the idea that Bitcoin will have a sharp increase in price from this last halving, like it did after the previous 2 times.

But it seems there are 2 things that would make each successive halving have less of an impact on Bitcoin:


1: As time passes more Bitcoin are mined, and so the amount of Bitcoin that comes from the ‚Äúblock reward‚Äù has less of an inpact on the overall supply.

2: Because each halving is a halving of the last halving, the reduction in block reward is smaller in absolute terms.

I started researching btc again because the gains caught my eye but the tech and ideology made a believer out of me.  Anyways covid hit and btc dumped to around 4k and I committed as big as I could.  I had to cash some out recently (don't trip im still holding id never sell it all lol) to buy my girlfriend of five years a ring.  We've been together almost five years and has had my back on everything thick and thin.  She used to help me out when I didn't have enough to pay the bills, and thanks to bitcoin I was finally able to afford to give her a ring that she absolutely loves.  On top of that, btc has also given me the ability to buy that ring, and still be financially stable!

As heading says, which is the best hardware wallet? I want to get a hardware wallet for me which suits the best, so I need your help. Please! I've been knowing about Ledger Nano S so is it the only Best hardware wallet? 

Here are something about the different hardware wallets I know, please correct me if I am wrong -

1. Ledger Nano X - a bit costly for me, and have been hearing that it is being hacked most of the times.

2. Ledger Nano S - budget friendly, however have been hearing that it is not much secure. Also it isn't mobile friendly 

3. Safepal S1 - fits all my needs, is budget friendly (40$), has connection with Mobile, supports all crypto, but it is from **China and I don't think Chinese marketplace is good. Also, I don't know how secure is this? Please I need help with this one**

4. Coldcard - hmm, I didn't like it Structure. Also is a bit costly for me.

5. Trezor - have been hearing that it can be hacked

6. Secux - is good but don't know how secure it is.


**Please this is my opinion on various hardware wallets. I need your help, and I have never ordered anything from outside so I also don't know how it will arrive. I am from Nepal so also don't know if they will be able to reach to my country. I don't have credit card so I can use only crypto to pay them. Please help me. And if it is under 60$ I can happily buy it, if it's not I'll still try to buy it. I also don't know about VAT and taxes. If there are other hardware wallets, please tell me that** or if there is a website or a doc which compares all the wallets, it will be good for me.

I know I asked you lots and lots of question. But answer to atleast one of them will make me happy.

"I‚Äôve had the nano a for around 3 years now and I‚Äôve been happy with it.
I‚Äôd like to upgrade as I see the Nano X is now available and I like that I can track my portfolio and use the X with the Ledger Live app straight from my phone.

Having done some research it looks like the Ledger isn‚Äôt the only option and I‚Äôve read a lot about the Coldcard which looks pretty cool.
I see a lot of people saying that ledger isn‚Äôt actually all that secure and that coldcard is the best option but it depends on your needs.

My needs are that I will be buying Bitcoin every week in small increments and just want to store it. I currently buy on Coinbase and wait until I have enough that makes the fees worth sending it my nano S.
I really like the usability of the live app as I like to see what‚Äôs going on.

I‚Äôve seen people say you can use the coldcard with a wallet app but how well does that work? I‚Äôd like to see my exact holdings without having to start up my PC.

Or are there any better options? The Opendime looks really cool but I understand it‚Äôs limitations as far as having to puncture it to transfer off of it.

" Some cryptocurrency custody services like Bitgo allow users to make wallets. Introducing this feature to regular users, not institutional ones, questions the self-control nature of the cryptocurrency world, so my story begins here.

I am using Bitgo to store my bitcoins since 2017 until I noticed my account is closed by Bitgo (actually frozen for 40 years) without any prior explanation. When I tried to contact their support, they closed every single ticket with no reply. So I decided to get back into the file they gave me when I registered first and opened wallet. I had ensured company reputation and wallet explanation during register that backup given file could recover my savings but I was Wrong.

After trying to use Bitgo [recovery tools](https://github.com/BitGo/wallet-recovery-wizard/releases/download/v2.6.5/BitGoWalletRecoveryWizard.Setup.2.6.5.exe) with the given backup file, It did not work out so I decided to read more about their protocols and figure out how this service works. So I found that they are using MultiSig with 2 of 3 threshold need to open the wallet. Keys were split between me, Bitgo and a KRS (Key recovery service) called Keyternal. This was not what I registered for and they were not mentioned any KRS back then so I thought I own bitcoins just by carrying the file. Anyway, I have my own key and need to get it signed by Bitgo or Keyternal. Bitgo is not even answering emails or tickets and Keyternal has not done anything in past 3 weeks. So I'm stuck between these two companies trying to get out my assets, though Keyternal does not look like a proper company (you can tell it from viewing their [website](https://keytern.al/)).

My final advice to you is to not use Bitgo AT ALL. They make you feel you have full access to your wallet and one day you become aware of the BIG MISTAKE you made.",Do not use Bitgo AT ALL!,2020,1

"I was introduced to Modern Monetary Theory through Stephanie Kelton‚Äôs book - The Deficit Myth

The central tenant of MMT is that as a Monetary Sovereign currency issuer, the US government can print as much money as it wants so we shouldn‚Äôt worry about running up large national debts/deficits. 

We‚Äôve seen this play out recently with the multi-trillion dollar stimulus plans and the proposed multi-trillion dollar climate plans - there‚Äôs no plan for paying back any of that money or any conversations about lowering the national debt/deficit. 

This likely means low interest rates (nearly zero in the US and negative interest rates in Europe) for quite a while.

This means that to effectively retire people cannot rely on traditional safe financial instruments like bonds / savings accounts. Instead needing to become proficient asset allocators (or needing hire someone to manage asset allocation for them). Adding this complexity to the system will be a problem for low information investors. 

That‚Äôs where Bitcoin comes in. As a store of value Bitcoin can replace the traditional savings account that yielded between 5 and 20(!!) percent during most of the late 1900s (when interest rates were higher spending was more controlled). 

TL;DR - MMT is a reality and has destroyed USD as store of value, Bitcoin fixes this

"HODL works because the day everyone does it, Bitcoin will have reached its potential - replacing the dollar as the defacto store of value and becoming the savings account of the masses.

Think about it, the average person right now does HODL something - cash. They HODL cash until they want / need to spend it on goods or services. 

In the near future, Bitcoin has the potential to play that role - people will HODL until they need to ‚Äúcash out‚Äù some to spend it on an economic good or service. 

So the ultimate point of HODL is not to sell later on for cash profit, but it‚Äôs teaching us to save and spend when we actually want to consume, knowing that we will not only keep the value we have stored, but be rewarded for it with higher purchasing power in the future.

I full well understand that a lot of people get into Bitcoin to make profit (profit denoted in fiat), but I believe many more will stay with Bitcoin because it will be the primary way they are able to save.

"18,562,756 out of 21,000,000 btc have already been mined, or about 88%, leaving only 12% to be mined.

The existing 88% is held primarily by plebs all over the internet, with a few OG whales and a very small set of high net worth individuals.

But governments, central banks, corporations and mega-rich individuals, despite all their wealth, are not yet large holders of btc.

They'll be fighting over that last unmined 12% of the supply.

What's the long term value of a sat, if all the demand of governments/central banks/corps/billionaires gets squeezed into only 12% of the btc supply?

Their only other option is to try to pry sats out of the hands of hodlers at whatever price a hodler asks.

But if the plebs hodl, the govs/banks/corps/billionaires will all be squeezed into that last 12% of supply.

"I come here as an investor who doesn't own any bitcoin

Many of the guys over at r/investing are salty as fuck and throwing around the usual 'bubble', 'greater fools' ya-da ya-da

For years they stood on the sidelines and mocked HODLers during the bad times. I hoped that they would at least have the integrity to acknowledge if things didn't go as they predicted. Sadly, it seems many are just going to keep making the same prediction, waiting to gloat the one time they get it right. Ironically, they hate it when people do this with stock market crashes

So I just want to recognise your achievement on getting to a point many said you never would reach. Anyone who has had the belief and discipline to HODL through thick and thin deserves congratulations on those diamond hands

I appreciate many of you are not doing this as a speculative investment and you do not care what the price is doing at any given time. So I understand my congratulations will mean little to you

Nonetheless, well done

Now keep HODLing",Just want to say Congratulations to all the HODLers (as a non-HODLer),2020,1
"**One of the last posts made by Hal Finney on¬†bitcointalk.org. For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from... Satoshi (for the uninitiated still, the builder of Bitcoin)...**

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.


p.s: If something has to get to¬†r/all, I wish it is some post like this, so people can really see what Bitcoin is, and not just its price and monetary value. Thanks for any and all upvotes..","In these days of only price talking, a piece of bitcoin when it was priceless",2020,1

"The whole purpose of Bitcoin is to take power from financial institutions and put it in your own hands. You are able to store your own BTC, and there are plenty of guides on how to do so.

When you purchase ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù from places like PayPal and robinhood, you are not buying Bitcoin. You‚Äôre simply buying a promise from the company, and they will be the owners of your Bitcoin. In doing so you allow them to perpetuate fractional reserve banking and other malicious practices, ultimately putting more money into the hands of greedy people at the top. Do not wait until it‚Äôs too late and a company finds it more profitable to take the Bitcoin and run.

"I belong from a working class family... I have never seen a lot of money... Seen some terrible times as well. But when I was 18, I was searching for ways to earn money on the internet and the word CRYPTO came up on my screen. And then the word BITCOIN showed up. (At that moment, I had no idea what it was) I did a lot of research and after a few weeks, I saved enough money to buy a good miner and started mining... I sold every coin I mined for BITCOIN! (Even tho I didn't completely understand it) So now, I was hodling some bitcoin and I researched on it a lot. All day every day. This kept on going.

To this day, I own 10+ Bitcoins and continuously making more. I even started to trade... I believe it was my fate to find the term crypto and I researched about bitcoin and more importantly, I HODL! I didn't sell any!

There is the chance that bitcoin actually exceeds our expectations and goes to a million.  ""When?"", is something nobody can answer.

"I‚Äôll start by saying I‚Äôm a grandmother, or at least old enough to be one. In 2014, I had a couple of grand in the bank so I asked a grower friend how could I invest in the newly legalized cannabis industry. 

Ive never been much of a saver, more of an impulsive spender, and never made much money either. Retirement age was looming and I knew I‚Äôd blown it. I was one of the majority of Americans, facing the possibility of living on a tiny social security wage, or working into my seventies. I needed something that would bring the biggest yields possible. I needed a miracle.

My cannabis friend told me about Bitcoin. I spent my spare time over the next few days devouring every video, every article I could find (thank you Andreas Antonopoulos you are my hero).

I found someone in my county, went to my bank and wired him some money, and he sent me a small amount of Bitcoin. I did this again and again (dude I don‚Äôt remember your name, but I hope you didn‚Äôt get in too much trouble for operating a money changing business back in the day).

I watched my $210 Bitcoin jump to over $1000. I was glued to the price ticker, and I sold the 20 bitcoins I‚Äôd accumulated at $880. Oh how I wish I‚Äôd have HODL‚Äôd at that price!

I started buying again at 440, then at 560, then at 900, 1100, 2200, etc. I set up an automatic buy at Coinbase for $50/week for a good year or two. An unexpected breakup led me at stop that auto buy, but I later resumed it at $10 week. I still have my $10/week buy. I call it my ‚Äúgambling money‚Äù.

Eventually I transferred my Bitcoin onto a hardware wallet, stamped out my keys onto a brass plate, and stashed them away in a safe. I keep a little bit on an exchange, and have cashed out drips and drabs to pay for my daughter‚Äôs college tuition and expenses.

I‚Äôve paid taxes on the gains I‚Äôve taken. 

This week for the first time it hit me. I‚Äôm not going to retire poor. I don‚Äôt have to worry. I don‚Äôt yet have enough for a full retirement, but there is no doubt in my mind that my little HODL‚Äôd stash will grow and grow. What a huge relief.

"***The Economic Effects of Inflation*** - What has Government done to our Money? by Rothbard

To gauge the economic effects of inflation, let us see what happens when a group of counterfeiters set about their work. Suppose the economy has a supply of 10,000 gold ounces, and counterfeiters, so cunning that they cannot be detected, pump in 2,000 ‚Äúounces‚Äù more. What will be the consequences? First, there will be a clear gain to the counterfeiters. They take the newly created money and use it to buy goods and services. The new money works its way, step by step, throughout the economic system. **As the new money spreads, it bids prices up‚Äîas we have seen, new money can only dilute the effectiveness of each dollar.** But this dilution takes time and is therefore uneven; in the meantime, some people gain and other people lose. In short, the counterfeiters and their local retailers have found their incomes increased before any rise in the prices of the things they buy. But, on the other hand, people in remote areas of the economy, who have not yet received the new money, find their buying prices rising before their incomes. Retailers at the other end of the country, for example, will suffer losses. **The first receivers of the new money gain most, and at the expense of the latest receivers**.

**Inflation, then, confers no general social benefit; instead, it redistributes the wealth in favor of the firstcomers and at the expense of the laggards in the race.** And inflation is, in effect, a race‚Äîto see who can get the new money earliest. The latecomers‚Äîthe ones stuck with the loss‚Äîare often called the ‚Äúfixed income groups.‚Äù Ministers, teachers, people on salaries, lag notoriously behind other groups in acquiring the new money. Particular sufferers will be those depending on fixed money contracts‚Äîcontracts made in the days before the inflationary rise in prices. Life insurance beneficiaries and annuitants, retired persons living off pensions, landlords with long term leases, bondholders and other creditors, those holding cash, all will bear the brunt of the inflation. They will be the ones who are ‚Äútaxed.‚Äù 

Inflation has other disastrous effects. **It distorts that keystone of our economy: business calculation. Since prices do not all change uniformly and at the same speed, it becomes very difficult for business to separate the lasting from the transitional, and gauge truly the demands of consumers or the cost of their operations.** For example, accounting practice enters the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of an asset at the amount the business has paid for it. But if inflation intervenes, the cost of replacing the asset on the books. As a result, business accounting will seriously overstate their profits during inflation‚Äîand may even consume capital while presumably increasing their investments. Similarly, stockholders and real estate holders will acquire capital gains during an inflation that are not really ‚Äúgains‚Äù at all. But they may spend part of these gains without realizing that they are thereby consuming their original capital. **By creating illusory profits and distorting economic calculation, inflation will suspend the free market‚Äôs penalizing of inefficient, and rewarding of efficient, firms.** Almost all firms will seemingly prosper. The general atmosphere of a ‚Äúsellers‚Äô market‚Äù will lead to a decline in the quality of goods and of service to consumers, since consumers often resist price increases less when they occur in the form of downgrading of quality. The quality of work will decline in an inflation for a more subtle reason: people become enamored of ‚Äúget-rich-quick‚Äù schemes, seemingly within their grasp in an era of ever-rising prices, and often scorn sober effort. Inflation also penalizes thrift and encourages debt, for any sum of money loaned will be repaid in dollars of lower purchasing power than when originally received. The incentive, then, is to borrow and repay later rather than save and lend. **Inflation, therefore, lowers the general standard of living in the very course of creating a tinsel atmosphere of ‚Äúprosperity.‚Äù** 

**Fortunately, inflation cannot go on forever.** For eventually people wake up to this form of taxation; they wake up to the continual shrinkage in the purchasing power of their dollar. At first, when prices rise, people say: ‚ÄúWell, this is abnormal, the product of some emergency. I will postpone my purchases and wait until prices go back down.‚Äù This is the common attitude during the first phase of an inflation. This notion moderates the price rise itself, and conceals the inflation further, since the demand for money is thereby increased. But, as inflation proceeds, people begin to realize that prices are going up perpetually as a result of perpetual inflation. Now people will say: ‚ÄúI will buy now, though prices are ‚Äòhigh,‚Äô because if I wait, prices will go up still further.‚Äù As a result, the demand for money now falls and prices go up more, proportionately, than the increase in the money supply. At this point, the government is often called upon to ‚Äúrelieve the money shortage‚Äù caused by the accelerated price rise, and it inflates even faster. Soon, the country reaches the stage of the ‚Äúcrack-up boom,‚Äù when people say: ‚ÄúI must buy anything now‚Äî anything to get rid of money which depreciates on my hands.‚Äù The supply of money skyrockets, the demand plummets, and prices rise astronomically. Production falls sharply, as people spend more and more of their time finding ways to get rid of their money. The monetary system has, in effect, broken down completely, and the economy reverts to other moneys, if they are attainable‚Äîother metal, foreign currencies if this is a one-country inflation, or even a return to barter conditions. The monetary system has broken down under the impact of inflation. 

This condition of hyper-inflation is familiar historically in the assignats of the French Revolution, the Continentals of the American Revolution, and especially the German crisis of 1923, and the Chinese and other currencies after World War II. 

**A final indictment of inflation is that whenever the newly issued money is first used as loans to business, inflation causes the dread ‚Äúbusiness cycle.‚Äù** This silent but deadly process, undetected for generations, works as follows: new money is issued by the banking system, under the aegis of government, and loaned to business. To businessmen, the new funds seem to be genuine investments, but these funds do not, like free-market investments, arise from voluntary savings. The new money is invested by businessmen in various projects, and paid out to workers and other factors as higher wages and prices. As the new money filters down to the whole economy, the people tend to re establish their old voluntary consumption/saving proportions.

In short, if people wish to save and invest about 20 percent of their incomes and consume the rest, new bank money loaned to business at first makes the saving proportion look higher. When the new money seeps down to the public, it re-establishes its old 20‚Äì80 proportion, and many investments are now revealed to be wasteful. **Liquidation of the wasteful investments of the inflationary boom constitutes the depression phase of the business cycle.**","""Inflation, then, confers no general social benefit; instead, it redistributes the wealth in favor of the firstcomers and at the expense of the laggards in the race"" - Rothbard",2019,1

"Bitcoin Holding $3,550 Means ‚ÄúNext Strong Move‚Äù is Building! 

Original Source: [Here](http://aourl.me/s/689tfa)

 

Ever since Bitcoin (BTC) **suddenly ran** on February 8th, posting a jaw-dropping performance that came straight out of left field, the broader crypto market has entered a lull. While there have been a few notable movers, like Binance Coin (BNB), the broader digital asset class has all but stopped moving. Price action has effectively come to a standstill.

This has left many asking, what‚Äôs next for the cryptocurrency market? While one analyst couldn‚Äôt give a definitive answer on whether BTC will move higher or lower, he argues that a breakout is festering, and is inbound.

[Bitcoin Charts](https://i.redd.it/ocd0j4e7w8h21.jpg)

 

## Analyst Hints At Bitcoin Breakout

Josh Rager, an advisor to TokenBacon and Blackwave, recently took to Twitter to convey some analysis regarding Bitcoin‚Äôs chart. While Josh didn‚Äôt have any explicit predictions, due to the non-volatility in BTC‚Äôs value, he did note that as the cryptocurrency has yet to break under its ‚Äúweekly historical support level,‚Äù it is likely building its ‚Äúnext strong move.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Josh's Tweet ](https://i.redd.it/4p1un9j5x8h21.png)

 

As aforementioned, he didn‚Äôt definitively or tacitly mention what which Bitcoin could head after its ends this lull, but considering theories regarding the ‚ÄúBart Formation,‚Äù some believers claim that BTC could plummet just as fast as it rallied on February 8th.

Josh‚Äôs recent comment comes after he took to his¬†Twitter soapbox to make an astute comment. Per **previous reports** from this outlet, the popular industry personality remarked that after 2019, potentially only a few in the ‚Äúgeneral population‚Äù will be able to afford an entire BTC. He added that while global income per household figures could swell, due to inflation, solid economic conditions, and other factors, after 2021, BTC‚Äôs ‚Äúspeculative value could be out of reach for most.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Crypto Could Fall Further

Interestingly, for once in a blue moon, few commentators are sure where the crypto market is headed in the short-term. But as **reported** by NewsBTC previously, the few analysts that have issued forecasts in these mundane market conditions expect losses in the near future.

"***DEFLATION - The Ethics of Money Production by Jorg Guido Hulsmann***

Still another variant of the same basic fallacy that we just discussed is the alleged need to fight deflation. The word ‚Äúdeflation‚Äù can be defined in various ways. According to the most widely accepted definition today, deflation is a sustained decrease of the price level. Older authors have often used the expression ‚Äúdeflation‚Äù to denote a decreasing money supply, and some contemporary authors use it to characterize a decrease of the inflation rate. All of these definitions are acceptable, depending on the purpose of the analysis. None of them, however, lends itself to justifying an artificial increase of the money supply. The harmful character of deflation is today one of the sacred dogmas of monetary policy. **The champions of the fight against deflation usually present six arguments to make their case**^14

1. One, in their eyes it is a matter of historical experience that deflation has negative repercussions on aggregate production and, therefore, on the standard of living. To explain this presumed historical record, they hold, 
1. Two, that deflation incites the market participants to postpone buying because they speculate on ever lower prices. Furthermore, they consider, 
1. Three, that a declining price level makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past. These difficulties threaten to entail, 
1. Four, a crisis within the banking industry and thus a dramatic curtailment of credit. 
1. Five, they claim that deflation in conjunction with ‚Äústicky prices‚Äù results in unemployment. And finally, 
1. Six, they consider that deflation might reduce nominal interest rates to such an extent that a monetary policy of ‚Äúcheap money,‚Äù to stimulate employment and production, would no longer be possible, because the interest rate cannot be decreased below zero.

**However, theoretical and empirical evidence substantiating these claims is either weak or lacking altogether.**^15 

***First***, in historical fact, deflation has had no clear negative impact on aggregate production. Long-term decreases of the price level did not systematically correlate with lower growth rates than those that prevailed in comparable periods and/or countries with increasing price levels. Even if we focus on deflationary shocks emanating from the financial system, **empirical evidence does not seem to warrant the general claim that deflation impairs long-run growth**.^16 

***Second***, it is true that unexpectedly strong deflation can incite people to postpone purchase decisions. However, this does not by any sort of necessity slow down aggregate production. Notice that, in the presence of deflationary tendencies, purchase decisions in general, and consumption in particular, does not come to a halt. For one thing, human beings act under the ‚Äúconstraint of the stomach.‚Äù Even the most neurotic misers, who cherish saving a penny above anything else, must make a minimum of purchases just to survive the next day. And all others‚Äîthat is, the great majority of the population‚Äî will by and large buy just as many consumers‚Äô goods as they would have bought in a nondeflationary environment. Even though they expect prices to decline ever further, they will buy goods and services at some point because they prefer enjoying these goods and services sooner rather than later (economists call this ‚Äútime preference‚Äù). In actual fact, then, consumption will slow down only marginally in a deflationary environment. **And this marginal reduction of consumer spending, far from impairing aggregate production, will rather tend to increase it**. The simple fact is that all resources that are not used for consumption are saved; that is, they are available for investment and thus help to extend production in those areas that previously were not profitable enough to warrant investment.

***Third***, it is correct that deflation‚Äîespecially unanticipated deflation‚Äîmakes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past. In the case of a massive deflation shock, widespread bankruptcy might result. Such consequences are certainly deplorable from the standpoint of the individual entrepreneurs and capitalists who own the firms, factories, and other productive assets when the deflationary shock hits. However, from the aggregate (social) point of view, it does not matter who controls the existing resources. What matters from this overall point of view is that resources remain intact and be used. Now the important point is that deflation does not destroy these resources physically. It merely diminishes their monetary value, which is why their present owners go bankrupt. **Thus deflation by and large boils down to a redistribution of productive assets from old owners to new owners.** The net impact on production is likely to be zero.

***Fourth***, it is true that deflation more or less directly threatens the banking industry, because deflation makes it more difficult for bank customers to repay their debts and because widespread business failures are likely to have a direct negative impact on the liquidity of banks. However, for the same reasons that we just discussed, while this might be devastating for some banks, it is not so for society as a whole. **The crucial point is that bank credit does not create resources; it channels existing resources into other businesses than those which would have used them if these credits had not existed**. It follows that a curtailment of bank credit does not destroy any resources; it simply entails a different employment of human beings and of the available land, factories, streets, and so on. In the light of the preceding considerations it appears that the problems entailed by deflation are much less formidable than they are in the opinion of present-day monetary authorities. Deflation certainly has much disruptive potential. However, as will become even more obvious in the following chapters, it mainly threatens institutions that are responsible for inflationary increases of the money supply. It reduces the wealth of fractional-reserve banks, and their customers‚Äî debt-ridden governments, entrepreneurs, and consumers. But as we have argued, such destruction liberates the underlying physical resources for new employment. The destruction entailed by deflation is therefore often ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù in the Schumpeterian sense^18.

***Fifth***. In the past eighty years, the sticky-prices argument has played an important role in monetary debates. According to this argument, the manipulation of the money supply might be a suitable instrument to re-establish a lost equilibrium on certain markets, most notably on the labor market. Suppose that powerful labor unions push up nominal wage rates in all industries to such an extent that entrepreneurs can no longer profitably employ a great part of the workforce at these wages. The result is mass unemployment. But if it were possible to substantially increase the money supply, then the selling prices of the entrepreneurs might rise enough to allow for the reintegration of the unemployed workers into the division of labor. Now, the argument goes, under a gold or silver standard, this kind of policy is impossible for purely technical reasons because the money supply is inflexible. Only a paper money provides the technical wherewithal to implement pro-employment policies. Thus we have here a prima facie justification for suppressing the natural commodity monies and supporting a paper money standard.

This argument grew into prominence during the 1920s in Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries. After World War II, it became something like a dogma of economic policy. But this does not alter the fact that it is sheer fallacy, and it is not even difficult to see the root of the fallacy. The argument is in fact premised on the notion that monetary policy makers can constantly outsmart the labor unions. The managers of the printing press can again and again surprise the labor-union leaders through another round of expansionist
monetary policy. Clearly, this is a silly assumption and in retrospect it is very astonishing that responsible men could ever have taken it seriously. The labor unions were not fooled. Faced with the reality of expansionist monetary policy, they eventually increased their wage demands to compensate for the declining purchasing power of money. **The result was stagflation‚Äîhigh unemployment plus inflation‚Äîa phenomenon that in the past thirty years has come to plague countries with strong labor unions such as France and Germany**.

***Sixth***. Another widespread fallacy is the idea that paper money could help to decrease the interest rate, thus promoting economic growth. If new paper tickets are printed and then first offered on the credit market, so the argument goes, the supply of credit is increased and as a consequence the price of credit‚Äîinterest‚Äîdeclines. Cheap money is now available for businessmen all over the country. They will invest more than they otherwise would have invested, and therefore economic growth will be enhanced.

There are actually a good number of different fallacies involved in this argument, and it is impossible for us to deal with all of them here.^19 [...] In short, economic growth is diminished below the level it could otherwise have reached. To sum up, it is by no means sure that politically induced increases of the money supply will lead to a decrease of the interest rate below the level it would have reached in a free economy. The success of cheap-money policy is especially unlikely when the policy is not adopted on an ad-hoc basis, but turned into a guiding principle of economic policy. But the fundamental objection to this policy is that it is counterproductive even if it succeeds in decreasing the interest rate. **The consequence would be more waste and thus less growth**.

"From the US:

A week ago, I found the exchange BiteBTC and thought it looked legit, so I submitted my documents for verification approval. After forgetting about it, I received an e-mail that said I was verified and I could start trading now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I enter the exchange and sign in, retrieve my BTC deposit address, and send almost $1,000 worth of BTC over to my BiteBTC Bitcoin wallet. After doing a little more looking around, I notice that there aren't many options to chose from. Disappointed, I try withdrawing my BTC back to my original wallet. And my nightmare begins...

&amp;#x200B;

First, I didn't see ANY record of the transaction AT ALL. After a few hours of freaking out since this has left me with $4.47 in my checking out, I finally SEE the transaction (note: has NOT entered the Blockchain yet) in the withdraw tab. Underneath is states:

If your application is processed more than 24 hours,  we ask you to click the ""Support"" button near such an application and  send a request to our financial support service.&lt;/i&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, I am a LITTLE relieved now. At that point, it had been 7 hours since I submitted the withdraw. 

&amp;#x200B;

I become increasingly nervous as the hours pass, now at 16 hours, I receive a response from support to the e-mail THEY ALLOWED ME TO SIGN UP WITH: ([protonmail.ch](https://protonmail.ch) account)

"Why is surprise the permanent condition
of the U.S. political and economic elite? In
2007‚Äì8, when the global financial system
imploded, the cry that no one could have
seen this coming was heard everywhere,
despite the existence of numerous analyses
showing that a crisis was unavoidable. 

The critical
issue is the artificial suppression of volatility‚Äîthe ups and downs of
life‚Äîin the name of stability. It is both misguided and dangerous to push unobserved
risks further into the statistical tails of the
probability distribution of outcomes and
allow these high-impact, low-probability
‚Äútail risks‚Äù to disappear from policymakers‚Äô
fields of observation. 

What the world is
witnessing is simply what happens when highly
constrained systems explode.
Complex systems that have artificially
suppressed volatility tend to become
extremely fragile, while at the same time
exhibiting no visible risks. In fact, they
tend to be too calm and exhibit minimal
variability as silent risks accumulate
beneath the surface.

 Although the stated
intention of political leaders and economic
policymakers is to stabilize the system by
inhibiting fluctuations, the result tends
to be the opposite. These artificially constrained systems become prone to ‚ÄúBlack
Swans‚Äù‚Äîthat is, they become extremely
vulnerable to large-scale events that lie far
from the statistical norm and were largely
unpredictable to a given set of observers.
Such environments eventually experience massive blowups, catching everyone
off-guard and undoing years of stability
or, in some cases, ending up far worse than
they were in their initial volatile state.
Indeed, the longer it takes for the blowup
to occur, the worse the resulting harm in
both economic and political systems.


Seeking to restrict variability seems to
be good policy (who does not prefer stability
to chaos?), so it is with very good intentions
that policymakers unwittingly increase the
risk of major blowups. And it is the same
misperception of the properties of natural
systems that led the economic
crisis of 2007‚Äì8. 

The policy implications
are: to make systems robust, all
risks must be visible and out in the open‚Äî
fluctuat nec mergitur (it fluctuates but does
not sink) goes the Latin saying.
Just as a robust economic system is one
that encourages early failures (the concepts
of ‚Äúfail small‚Äù and ‚Äúfail fast‚Äù), the U.S. government should stop supporting dictatorial regimes for the sake of pseudostability
and instead allow political noise to rise to
the surface. Making an economy robust
in the face of business swings requires
allowing risk to be visible; the same is
true in politics.

SEDUCED BY STABILITY
Both the recent financial crisis and the political crises in the Middle East
are grounded in the rise of complexity,
interdependence, and unpredictability.
Policymakers in the UK and
the USA have long promoted
policies aimed at eliminating fluctuation‚Äî
no more booms and busts in the economy,
no more ‚ÄúIranian surprises‚Äù in foreign
policy. These policies have almost always
produced undesirable outcomes.

 For
example, the U.S. banking system became
very fragile following a succession of progressively larger bailouts and government
interventions, particularly after the 1983
rescue of major banks (ironically, by the
same Reagan administration that trumpeted free markets). 

In the United States,
promoting these bad policies has been a
bipartisan effort throughout. Republicans
have been good at fragilizing large corporations through bailouts, and Democrats have
been good at fragilizing the government.


At the same time, the financial system as a
whole exhibited little volatility; it kept getting weaker while providing policymakers
with the illusion of stability, illustrated
most notably when Ben Bernanke, who
was then a member of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve, declared
the era of ‚Äúthe great moderation‚Äù in 2004.


Putatively independent central
bankers fell into the same trap. During
the 1990s, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair
Alan Greenspan wanted to iron out the
economic cycle‚Äôs booms and busts, and he
sought to control economic swings with
interest-rate reductions at the slightest
sign of a downward tick in the economic
data. Furthermore, he adapted his economic policy to guarantee bank rescues,
with implicit promises of a backstop‚Äîthe
now infamous ‚ÄúGreenspan put.‚Äù 

These
policies proved to have grave delayed side
effects. Washington stabilized the market
with bailouts and by allowing certain companies to grow ‚Äútoo big to fail.‚Äù Because
policymakers believed it was better to do
something than to do nothing, they felt
obligated to heal the economy rather than
wait and see if it healed on its own.


The foreign policy equivalent is to
support the incumbent no matter what.
And just as banks took wild risks thanks to
Greenspan‚Äôs implicit insurance policy, client
governments such as Hosni Mubarak‚Äôs in
Egypt for years engaged in overt plunder
thanks to similarly reliable U.S. support.


Those who seek to prevent volatility on
the grounds that any and all bumps in the
road must be avoided paradoxically increase
the probability that a tail risk will cause a
major explosion.


Consider a thought experiment, a man placed in an artificially
sterilized environment for a decade and
then invited to take a ride on a crowded
subway; he would be expected to die
quickly. Likewise, preventing small forest
fires can cause larger forest fires to become
devastating. This property is shared by
all complex systems.


In the realm of economics, price controls are designed to constrain volatility on
the grounds that stable prices are a good
thing. But although these controls might
work in some rare situations, the long-term
effect of any such system is an eventual
and extremely costly blowup whose cleanup
costs can far exceed the benefits accrued.


The risks of a dictatorship, no matter how
seemingly stable, are no different, in the
long run, from those of an artificially
controlled price.
Such attempts to institutionally engineer
the world come in two types: those that
conform to the world as it is and those
that attempt to reform the world. The
nature of humans, quite reasonably, is to intervene in an effort to alter their world and
the outcomes it produces. But government
interventions are laden with unintended‚Äî
and unforeseen‚Äîconsequences, particularly
in complex systems, so humans must work
with nature by tolerating systems that
absorb human imperfections rather than
seek to change them.


Take, for example, the recent celebrated
documentary on the financial crisis, Inside
Job, which blames the crisis on the malfeasance and dishonesty of bankers and the
incompetence of regulators. Although it
is morally satisfying, the film naively overlooks the fact that humans have always been
dishonest and regulators have always
been behind the curve. The only difference
this time around was the unprecedented
magnitude of the hidden risks and a misunderstanding of the statistical properties
of the system.


**What is needed is a system that can
prevent the harm done to citizens by the
dishonesty of business elites; the limited
competence of forecasters, economists, and
statisticians; and the imperfections of
regulation, not one that aims to eliminate
these flaws.** 

Humans must try to resist the
illusion of control: just as foreign policy
should be intelligence-proof (it should
minimize its reliance on the competence
of information-gathering organizations
and the predictions of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in what
are inherently unpredictable domains),
the economy should be regulator-proof,
given that some regulations simply make
the system itself more fragile. Due to the
complexity of markets, intricate regulations
simply serve to generate fees for lawyers
and profits for sophisticated derivatives
traders who can build complicated financial
products that skirt those regulations. 

DON‚ÄôT BE A TURKEY
The life of a turkey before Thanksgiving
is illustrative: the turkey is fed for 1,000
days and every day seems to confirm that
the farmer cares for it‚Äîuntil the last day,
when confidence is maximal. The ‚Äúturkey
problem‚Äù occurs when a naive analysis of
stability is derived from the absence of
past variations. Likewise, confidence in
stability was maximal at the onset of the
financial crisis in 2007.


The turkey problem for humans is the
result of mistaking one environment for
another.

 Humans simultaneously inhabit
two systems: the linear and the complex.

The linear domain is characterized by its
predictability and the low degree of
interaction among its components, which
allows the use of mathematical methods
that make forecasts reliable. 

In complex
systems, there is an absence of visible
causal links between the elements, masking
a high degree of interdependence and
extremely low predictability.

Nonlinear
elements are also present, such as those
commonly known, and generally misunderstood, as ‚Äútipping points.‚Äù Imagine
someone who keeps adding sand to a sand
pile without any visible consequence, until
suddenly the entire pile crumbles. It would
be foolish to blame the collapse on the last
grain of sand rather than the structure of the
pile, but that is what people do consistently,
and that is the policy error.

U.S. President Barack Obama may
blame an intelligence failure for the government‚Äôs not foreseeing the revolution
in Egypt (just as former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter blamed an intelligence
failure for his administration‚Äôs not foreseeing the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran),
but it is the suppressed risk in the statistical tails that matters‚Äînot the failure to
see the last grain of sand. As a result of
complicated interdependence and contagion effects, in all man-made complex
systems, a small number of possible events
dominate, namely, Black Swans.


Engineering, architecture, astronomy,
most of physics, and much of common
science are linear domains. The complex
domain is the realm of the social world,
epidemics, and economics. 

Crucially, the
linear domain delivers mild variations
without large shocks, whereas the complex
domain delivers massive jumps and gaps.
Complex systems are misunderstood,
mostly because humans‚Äô sophistication,
obtained over the history of human knowledge in the linear domain, does not transfer
properly to the complex domain. 

Humans
can predict a solar eclipse and the trajectory
of a space vessel, but not the stock market
or Egyptian political events. All man-made
complex systems have commonalities and
even universalities. Sadly, deceptive calm
(followed by Black Swan surprises) seems
to be one of those properties.


THE ERROR OF PREDICTION


As with a crumbling sand pile, it would be
foolish to attribute the collapse of a fragile
bridge to the last truck that crossed it, and
even more foolish to try to predict in
advance which truck might bring it down.

The system is responsible, not the components. But after the financial crisis of
2007‚Äì8, many people thought that predicting the subprime meltdown would have
helped. It would not have, since it was a
symptom of the crisis, not its underlying
cause. Likewise, Obama‚Äôs blaming ‚Äúbad intelligence‚Äù for his administration‚Äôs failure to
predict the crisis in Egypt is symptomatic
of both the misunderstanding of complex
systems and the bad policies involved.
Obama‚Äôs mistake illustrates the illusion
of local causal chains‚Äîthat is, confusing
catalysts for causes and assuming that one
can know which catalyst will produce which
effect. The final episode of the upheaval in
Egypt was unpredictable for all observers,
especially those involved. As such, blaming the cia is as foolish as funding it to
forecast such events. Governments are
wasting billions of dollars on attempting
to predict events that are produced by
interdependent systems and are therefore
not statistically understandable at the
individual level.


As Mark Abdollahian of Sentia Group,
one of the contractors who sell predictive
analytics to the U.S. government, noted
regarding Egypt, policymakers should
‚Äúthink of this like Las Vegas. In blackjack,
if you can do four percent better than the
average, you‚Äôre making real money.‚Äù But
the analogy is spurious. 

There is no ‚Äúfour
percent better‚Äù on Egypt. This is not just
money wasted but the construction of a
false confidence based on an erroneous
focus. It is telling that the intelligence
analysts made the same mistake as the
risk-management systems that failed to
predict the economic crisis‚Äîand offered
the exact same excuses when they failed.
Political and economic ‚Äútail events‚Äù are
unpredictable, and their probabilities are
not scientifically measurable. 

No matter
how many dollars are spent on research,
predicting revolutions is not the same as
counting cards; humans will never be able
to turn politics into the tractable randomness of blackjack.
Most explanations being offered for the
current turmoil in the Middle East follow
the ‚Äúcatalysts as causes‚Äù confusion. The
riots in Tunisia and Egypt were initially
attributed to rising commodity prices, not
to stifling and unpopular dictatorships.
But Bahrain and Libya are countries with
high gdps that can a¬™ord to import grain
and other commodities. Again, the focus is
wrong even if the logic is comforting. It is
the system and its fragility, not events,
that must be studied‚Äîwhat physicists call
‚Äúpercolation theory,‚Äù in which the properties of the terrain are studied rather than
those of a single element of the terrain.
When dealing with a system that is
inherently unpredictable, what should be
done? Differentiating between two types
of countries is useful. In the first, changes
in government do not lead to meaningful
di¬™erences in political outcomes (since
political tensions are out in the open).
In the second type, changes in government lead to both drastic and deeply
unpredictable changes.
Consider that Italy, with its muchmaligned ‚Äúcabinet instability,‚Äù is economically and politically stable despite having
had more than 60 governments since
World War II (indeed, one may say Italy‚Äôs
stability is because of these switches of
government). 

Similarly, in spite of consistently bad press, Lebanon is a relatively
safe bet in terms of how far governments
can jump from equilibrium; in spite of
all the noise, shifting alliances, and street
protests, changes in government there
tend to be comparatively mild. For example, a shift in the ruling coalition from
Christian parties to Hezbollah is not such
a consequential jump in terms of the
country‚Äôs economic and political stability.


Switching equilibrium, with control of
the government changing from one party
to another, in such systems acts as a shock
absorber. Since a single party cannot have
total and more than temporary control, the
possibility of a large jump in the regime
type is constrained.


In contrast, consider Iran and Iraq.
Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and Saddam Hussein both constrained volatility
by any means necessary. In Iran, when
the shah was toppled, the shift of power to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a huge,
unforeseeable jump. After the fact, analysts
could construct convincing accounts about
how killing Iranian Communists, driving
the left into exile, demobilizing the democratic opposition, and driving all dissent
into the mosque had made Khomeini‚Äôs
rise inevitable. 

In Iraq, the United States
removed the lid and was actually surprised
to find that the regime did not jump from
hyperconstraint to something like France.
But this was impossible to predict ahead
of time due to the nature of the system
itself. What can be said, however, is that
the more constrained the volatility, the
bigger the regime jump is likely to be. From
the French Revolution to the triumph of
the Bolsheviks, history is replete with
such examples, and yet somehow humans
remain unable to process what they mean.



Humans fear randomness‚Äîa healthy
ancestral trait inherited from a different
environment. Whereas in the past, which
was a more linear world, this trait enhanced
fitness and increased chances of survival,
it can have the reverse effect in today‚Äôs
complex world, making volatility take the
shape of nasty Black Swans hiding behind
deceptive periods of ‚Äúgreat moderation.‚Äù


This is not to say that any and all volatility
should be embraced. Insurance should
not be banned, for example.


But alongside the ‚Äúcatalysts as causes‚Äù
confusion sit two mental biases: the illusion
of control and the action bias (the illusion
that doing something is always better than
doing nothing). This leads to the desire to
impose man-made solutions. Greenspan‚Äôs
actions were harmful, but it would have
been hard to justify inaction in a democracy
where the incentive is to always promise a
better outcome than the other guy, regardless of the actual, delayed cost.


Variation is information. When there
is no variation, there is no information.
This explains the cia‚Äôs failure to predict
the Egyptian revolution and, a generation
before, the Iranian Revolution‚Äîin both
cases, the revolutionaries themselves did
not have a clear idea of their relative
strength with respect to the regime they
were hoping to topple. 

So rather than subsidize and praise as a ‚Äúforce for stability‚Äù
every tin-pot potentate on the planet,
the U.S. government should encourage
countries to let information flow upward
through the transparency that comes with
political agitation. It should not fear fluctuations per se, since allowing them to be
in the open, as Italy and Lebanon both
show in different ways, creates the stability
of small jumps.


As Seneca wrote in De clementia,
‚ÄúRepeated punishment, while it crushes
the hatred of a few, stirs the hatred of
all . . . just as trees that have been trimmed
throw out again countless branches.‚Äù The
imposition of peace through repeated
punishment lies at the heart of many
seemingly intractable conflicts, including
the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate. 

Furthermore, dealing with seemingly reliable
high-level offcials rather than the people
themselves prevents any peace treaty signed
from being robust. The Romans were wise
enough to know that only a free man under
Roman law could be trusted to engage in a
contract; by extension, only a free people
can be trusted to abide by a treaty.

 Treaties
that are negotiated with the consent of a
broad swath of the populations on both
sides of a conflict tend to survive. 

Just as no
central bank is powerful enough to dictate
stability, no superpower can be powerful
enough to guarantee solid peace alone.


U.S. policy toward the Middle East has
historically, and especially since 9/11, been
unduly focused on the repression of any
and all political fluctuations in the name
of preventing ‚ÄúIslamic fundamentalism‚Äù‚Äî
a trope that Mubarak repeated until his
last moments in power and that Libyan
leader Muammar al-Qaddafi continues
to emphasize today, blaming Osama
bin Laden for what has befallen him. This
is wrong. The West and its autocratic Arab
allies have strengthened Islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground,
and even more so by killing them.


As Jean-Jacques Rousseau put it, ‚ÄúA
little bit of agitation gives motivation to
the soul, and what really makes the species
prosper is not peace so much as freedom.‚Äù
With freedom comes some unpredictable
fluctuation. This is one of life‚Äôs packages:
there is no freedom without noise‚Äîand
no stability without volatility","Bitcoins volatility is a feature,not a bug. Complex systems that have artificially suppressed volatility become fragile, they tend to exhibit minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the surface then the highly constrained systems explode.

"Buy low, sell high. Yeah, that's simple and has served people well during the previous bull runs. But what if it's different this time. 

Consider Venezuela, for example. Over the last several years, it's a mistake to have traded in your bitcoin for bolivars. Yes, you would have realized many more bolivars than before but so what if the value of bolivars keeps falling.

The US is at 22 trillion debt and I just saw Alan Greenspan explain that they'll just keep printing money to get out of debt. You mean like Venezuela does? Like Zimbabwe has? Like every other government around the world that's rekt because of it?

When Tim Draper was asked when will he sell his bitcoin, he responded by rhetorically asking ""sell it for what?"" His point is the same I'm making here. If the Dollar tanks, it's still not a great deal to have a million of them just like people don't care about a million bolivars now. 

The IMF and other institutions have been wearing it more openly on their sleeve recently that the world economy has an overdue appointment with hard times. The worst of times some people say when comparing how over leveraged we are to previous times. 

So, when the next bull run happens, is bailing back to the US Dollar the right play again or will people agree in hindsight that bitcoin is the new, real money and we should not have traded it away for fiat again?",I can't decide how to respond to the next bull run.,2019,1

,The real fools,2019,1
"I know that if you look at Bitcoin it's hard to believe the last ten years could be repeated.
Most of the people who have an exposure to Bitcoin thought the same when looking at it in 2017 when it was below 4k, or even further down the road when it was at 1k, or when it was at 400 a coin, etc.

Try to look at why it came from sub Dollar a coin to where we are now.
The fundamentals are the same but everything around it has evolved in making it's usage better.
Bitcoin still has by far the biggest development team behind it.
It's still evolving and not like most shitcoins just a copy of something existing with one or a few improvements that are sold by smart salesman as the next revolution but mostly right after that fall dead in the water because maintenance or development goes quickly to zero.

Look at what is happening to the debts building up everywhere; individual, governments, companies, banks.
How is that ever going to be paid back, just by printing more of it?
Is it possible to just keep on creating money with no end.
If it's that easy wouldn't we all be rich already by banks just printing infinite amounts and giving it to all of us?

Even of you don't understand how the fiat system works, you probably will realize we cannot create wealth by just printing fiat, but that is the only thing we are doing right know and have been doing for a long time.

Bitcoin is like Gold in that respect, it can't be created at almost no cost like fiat can.
So it can't create inflation like printing fiat does.
Bitcoin is sound money like gold and silver once was but just modern version, better suited for and made possible by computers and the internet.
If Bitcoin will succeed in reaching its ultimate goal we will have a lot wealth that has to be flowing into it, in fact we would only just have being started with that process.

No one can quarantee it will succeed since nobody can look into the future.
So don't invest more than you can afford is rule #1.
But the longer it survives the bigger the chances of succeeding will be.

You can wait for it to prove its ultimate destination but then you will also be paying the amount of wealth it will represent at that time.
If you get onboard in a suitably time, does ~80% below last ath sound good enough?, you could enjoy the ride up with us.

Know where you put your money in is rule #2 so read up on what Bitcoin is how it works.
If you do not own your private key you don't own your coins is rule #3
Keep your amount of wealth to yourself would be #4

There are more things you should know but if @4 don't let anyone or anything stop you from having some exposure to Bitcoin.
Not because you will help me or other Bitcoin owners, but simply because having no exposure is in my believe a bigger risk than having a balanced exposure to it, even when I tell you you can lose that part completely.

Let me finish with #5: just have some patience.

Even top advisors around the country are seeing the light: https://finteknews.com/financial-advisors-turn-bullish-on-bitcoin-after-learning-session/  but not technically and foresight inept journalists: https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-surges-15-overnight-because-nobody-learned-the-1833737971

For the doubters who say Bitcoin and other cryptos have no value, here is a quick list to prove them wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

- Online/digital medium of exchange for a growing crypto industry:  Security tokens, in game tokens, computing platforms value tokens, etc..

&amp;nbsp;

- BTC will likely be a better store of value than gold.  BTC inflation is perfectly predictable, there are no storage fees, it is more difficult to confiscate than gold, its easier to transfer cross boarder.  In a practical sense you cant transact every day with gold, you easily can with BTC and others.

&amp;nbsp;

- Value to merchant from no transaction fee from credit card provider (BTC through Lightning and other crypos have almost no transaction cost)

&amp;nbsp;

- No chargebacks/finality for merchants (this is a huge issue as any business owner knows especially in the leisure space).  I know business owners where most of their time is spent fighting chargebacks.

&amp;nbsp;

- Privacy of payer: BTC/other payments do not need a name attached to them.  This is great for slightly embarrassing purchases.

&amp;nbsp;

- Political donations and other purchases/payments where a user does not want to be tracked.  This is great for the US but especially in less stable countries around the world.

&amp;nbsp;

- BTC in particular is/can be a more stable currency than local fiat in some unstable countries.  However, the infrastructure must be in place for this to be realized (payment processors like Square for merchants and easy access wallets like the ones just now rolling out on phones).

&amp;nbsp;

- Micro-tipping/micro-payments

&amp;nbsp;

- Its going to be ridiculous for global websites and dapps to accept micropayments/payments in 100 different currencies.  I see BTC being the internet currency. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Banks the unbanked around the world and we can expect an entire micro-financing infrastructure based around bitcoin to open up going forward.  We are already seeing this with BitFi  (savings account with custody provided by Gemini).  This is just one basic product.  We will probably see pooled loans and other decentralized services. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Perfect control of assets/wealth store, completely removes the middleman of trust/banks.  Lets individuals be their own bank and gain leverage over financial institutions who take deposits and pay almost nothing to depositors.

&amp;nbsp;

- Diversification of portfolios with alternative correlation to securities

&amp;nbsp;

- Difficult to replicate because of network effect, liquidity, medium positioning, coin diversification that takes decades and allows the MC to rise.","Bitcoin Goes Up And Mainstream Journalists Are In Disbelief, Making Excuses And Doubling Down That It Has No Value",2019,1

"I saw this on Zero Hedge:

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of London-based cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, said the move was likely triggered by an algorithmic order worth about $100 million spread across major exchanges - U.S.-based Coinbase and Kraken, and Luxembourg-based Bitstamp.

""There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges ‚Äì there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour‚Äù.

So there was an influx of some $100 million that caused Bitcoin to rise $1000 a coin.
Yes I guess it triggered some shorts to be covered etc..

But an influx of $100 million is just a small amount when looking at some budgets.
Russia is roughly buying a million ounces of gold each month, that's more than one billion $.
What if Russia decided to invest half of that money next month into Bitcoin...

If it would only have the same effect of that $100 million influx Bitcoin would rise $5000 a coin.
What if Russia would do that the coming 12 months?
What if China decided to join after some months, what if they would double that amount.

You can bet other countries wouldn't be just watching and see where the price would go to.
Nor would the average investor and others.
It will simply be a waterfall of countries, investors, companies and normal people who will blindly jump in and the absurd price movements would make December 2017 look like a minor spike on the charts.

Wishful thinking, absurd, dreaming you say?
Well guess what I was told halfway 2017 when I said I expected Bitcoin to be worth more than $10k within 5 years time.
How could I know it would be double that prediction in only 6 months...

It's simple math, if governments, pension funds, investors, etc will just be toe tipping into Bitcoin, the price movements will be so big that December 2017 will look like a warmup party.

There will be so many spikes like today, and bigger, for such a long time it will be on every news outlet, in each newspaper, be talked about at every coffee machine, and here at reddit we will see people go crazy like never before.

At this moment it's still a gamble if this will work out let alone when, so invest only what you are willing to loose.
But once it gains momentum don't think you will have much time left to start learning about it, setup an account, start accumulating.

I simply don't see any other escape from the devastating fiat ponzy we are in right now.
It will be both the realization of the worthlessness of fiat combined with the insight that Bitcoin is different that will cause an unstoppable wealth transfer.

When will you start to see it, start to believe in it, start to transfer your wealth into Bitcoin?
At 10k, at 100k?
Why don't you think out a plan, make up your mind about what would convince you Bitcoin isn't some scam?
At what price level would you think it is safe to gamble/invest 1% of your wealth into it, when to invest 10% of your wealth in it?
Would you be ready if the first pension fund announced it invested in it, or if a small country would admit it put some of it's reserves into it?
Just think about it, make a plan, be ahead of the herds.

The next ath will probably take the price to a level where an average family will have a very hard time to just get 1 Bitcoin, but could easily take it to levels it will just become impossible.
Even if after that ath it would drop again with 70-80% it will very likely be way above the current price.
And if you would go and explore above samples and realize how much money will be involved it's hard to imagine it will ever again reach current levels once those gates are opened.
Compare it to what it would take to invest $5k right now.

I try to explain I think it's a bigger risk to have no exposure at all than to miss out if Bitcoin would succeed.

Don't go crazy with your exposure, but investing some money you can miss, to me that is more sound than dismissing Bitcoin all together.
Don't just believe what i say, learn what Bitcoin is how it works, make sure you understand where you put your hard earned money into.

But start learning today, you won't be able to go back in time.",If an influx of some $100 million moves the price of one Bitcoin with a $1000.........,2019,1

"Recently I have been trying to learn everything there is to learn about bitcoin.

I think that everything ‚Äòold‚Äô that I‚Äôve read has been a huge indicator of what is on the horizon for btc.

It looks like a lot of people were afraid of what could happen to bitcoin if it was hardforked. Would it survive?

And here we are now... even at 3k bitcoin, when you look at old discussions that took place when bitcoin was in the $8 and teens range, hell, look at the attitude people had towards bitcoin when it finally started having monetary value, @ 3k it is doing fantastic. And look at it climbing.

I was reading through an old eBay thread from 2010 or 2011 maybe, I wish I could find it in my browsing history, I can‚Äôt any more, and someone tried to pitch eBay accepting bitcoin and they were ridiculed away and heavily rejected for even pitching the idea. And here we are now... eBay announced they‚Äôll start accepting bitcoin last month.

I‚Äôm seeking some honest evaluation by anyone reading- what are some ‚Äòthreats‚Äô that exist on bitcoin‚Äôs horizon? Here are some things that come to mind that I am wondering about-

1) bug in the software that causes a flash crash of the price, or irredeemably wrecks the software. Is that even possible?

2) the people that contribute to the code fuck up or there is some silent code change- is this even possible? Consider this: satoshi silently added the 1mb limit when it was still being hosted on sorceforge. I am wondering about people who say that their fork is the real bitcoin and call btc things like ‚Äòsegwit coin.‚Äô My understanding is that segwit has no downsides (?) and reduces fees, and that big blockers are just bullshitting. I like the decentralization aspect of bitcoin.

3) Are mining pools a point of potential weakness? My understanding is that they are not decentralized.

4) when someone starts accepting bitcoin, but they immediately convert it to fiat and sell, or they go thru a company that does this, is that ‚Äòbad‚Äô for bitcoin? There‚Äôs a Reddit post 4 or 5 years ago on this subreddit where jimmywales1 says he started a bitcoin wallet, was receiving donations, will be cashing them out and donating the money to Wikipedia, and users were urging him to keep the bitcoin as bitcoin. Did Wikipedia ever start accepting bitcoin donations? Do they still immediately cash out? Is it still considered a highly speculative asset? Or do they now hold some? Jimmy Wales says that they hold a few different currencies that they actively use, so it would be interesting to see if in 2019 Wikipedia is now holding some coins themselves as-is. That would be a really big indicator for where we are headed with bitcoin.

Finally, where do you personally see the end of bitcoin being? I‚Äôm in the bitcoin subreddit I realize, but I do not think that discards anyone from being able to think critically and take a look at the network and try to assign value to it. For example, I recall someone writing in an old post from maybe 2010 that buying bitcoin now is basically like buying manhattan for a quarter.

Hindsight is 20/20.

When did you first hear about bitcoin? What year/price was it? Did you hear about it and not pay attention to it at first? Even Gregory Maxwell dismissed bitcoin at first! Looking at it now, where do you think it will end up looking like- will it save the world? Will it save all of the dying children in the world? I think roger ver said something about bitcoin saving all the dead babies?

2009... 2019... where do you foresee bitcoin being in 2029?

I wish we could confidently look into the future and say it will at least be greater than 9k usd for each coin. We can‚Äôt really confidently say that, though, can we? What if it isn‚Äôt as liquid as it is now. Is that even possible? Have we hit the point of no return with bitcoin? Is it officially established? No way to tell, huh.

I'm familiar with gold and silver where someone has to buy if you want to sell but if bitcoin is at $400,000 is anyone going to be buying bitcoin at that level?

"Hey!

Ok, so first off, if this enquiry is mislabeled or in the wrong place, please feel free to refer me to something accordingly...!

I have a question about wallets/markets usable on Android.

I've tried multiple wallets and market apps over the last years, but they all either got discontinued, had so ridiculous fees it was unbearable or had other problems, and I'm kinda desperate at this point...

Ok so basically what I'm currently looking for (assuming such thing even exists hopefully) is a way to facilitate small regular transaction in BTC and maybe some of the other popular cryptos. Like here 5$ or there 40$ and so on. So basically a wallet (preferably Android - otherwise online or MacOS) that is good equipped to send and receive (smaller) amounts regularly, like a 'normal' payment tool. And then a way (preferably right within the wallet, but that is going to be rather difficult to find I assume) to just regularly buy small amounts of coins there, with fees as small as possible and without hassle or literal hours of waiting time, just with credit/debit card, PayPal (yes I know still largely not available for buying cryptos) and like, that has like 5$ or 10$ or ‚Ç¨ as minium buy quantity and not 50$ or 70$...
So that in the end I'll be able to just quickly, swiftly and without hassle buy, send and receive and store small amounts regularly whenever I need to?

So I thought I'll just enroll this quest for that here, in the hope that someone is either looking for the same, has solutions, recommendations or experiences with the above!

"well, actually not everything, just anything that was liquid. My stocks, altcoins, my savings. I tried to even move my 401K into a bitcoin IRA, but they said I didn't have enough money. I needed $5,000 but I only had $3,500 in my account. It is a huge bummer because I could have gotten 1/3 of a  bitcoin. I'm wondering if it is worth withdrawing for straight cash and use that to purchase bitcoin with or just keep in old school fiat??? Maybe you guys can help me decide.

I've been involved with Cryptocurrencies ever since JUST before the 2017 bull run. That means even though the bear market of 2018, even when it was just $3,000, I was still buying in both scared and excited that it REALLY could go to zero (at least it seemed that way at the time) or be apart of a new global revolution. Of course, now I'm kicking myself for not dollar-cost averaging more when I could have bought 0.01 bitcoin at a time for $30!!! Now 0.01 bitcoin costs just over $100.

That would basically be me taking my entire life savings and putting it into Bitcoin. Is that a completely batshit insane thing to be thinking of doing?

My reasoning is this. Purchase 1 Bitcoin now, hold until the halvening, then take back out the amount of FIAT I put in and HODL the rest. If it‚Äôs worth less at that point then I just cut my losses and get out.

I just started at bitcoin few months ago. I have tons of questions and definitely need some help, I'm completly surpassed with information and it makes pretty difficult to learn something at all. I have previous knowledge about the FOREX since i was learning about that before i got much more interested in crypto currencys. I would like to know what do you recommend me to do... Where to inform my self, some tips, where to buy/sell Bitcoins and altcoins (ATM im using Coinbase) and stuff like that. Im trying to learn all of this by my self but i will appreciate if someone can help me a little bit.

*To check the plausibility of the estimate results, we also deduct the market capitalizations and stock to flow ratios of gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The sources here are the classical publications in which stocks and production quantities are reported. In particular, we are faced with the question of which is the appropriate number for the respective production. In order to keep the data mining process simple, we consider only mine production as production, i.e. the process that ""uses the Earth"", i.e. adding a new raw material to the economic cycle.

**^(Logarithmic scales, x-axis: stock to flow values, y-axis: market capitalization in USD (billions))**

*The most exciting thing, of course, is looking to the future. That's how Bitcoin's Stock to Flow-value in May 2020 - i.e. after the next halving: From currently approx. On the other hand, Gold's stock to flow value of currently around 58 will rise from 25.8 to almost 53 in May 2020. are only marginally higher, if at all. If you take this May value for Bitcoins Stock to Flow in the model feeds, comes a dizzying price of about* ***90,000 USD per Bitcoin***\*. Accordingly, in the current price of around 8,000 USD, the the pending halving effect is hardly priced in (the current model value is approx. 7,500 USD).\*

"FEBRUARY 4TH /// #THEBIGHOWL

// 9PM EST  FEBRUARY 4TH //

My fellow Shibes... As many of you have by now heard, popular trading companies such as Robinhood have slowed and and in some cases halted your ability to invest into Doge. This is a blatant attempt to manipulate the market and stop their own losses whilst slowing the momentum of our beloved Doge coin. And as the class action lawsuits will prove to the world... We have been wronged.

Because of this and the stupendously large amount of people trying to make accounts for the first time and the sheer amount of deposit fund requests, many of our comrades have been unable to board the rocket to the moon. But! This community never leaves a Doge behind and has, through all these years, had one another's backs. Whether you bought in early for peanuts or late with the change down the back of the sofa, there has never been a reddit community so united and truly indivisible. A place where the constant attempts by media and corporate giants to separate us by race, colour, sexuality, belief or creed have no effect. We are all equal in Doge. 

My long-winded proposal is this! To allow for the rest of our community to regroup and refuel, continue to buy the dips if you can but most importantly HOLD. 
If we can work together to hold our value until the 4TH OF FEBRUARY we can reignite this rocketship with the limitless might of the entire Doge army onboard! 

Please spread the word by simply leaving #THEBIGHOWL in the bottom of any comment or post you make this week so that we can alert as many of our family as possible!

To help put things into perspective for everyone, please vote on the poll below to show where you currently stand and just how many of us there really are!

Together we can make it to the moon üöÄ

EDIT: Protip for anyone worried about not being able to deposit on the day, you can deposit now into another crypto of your choosing and then simply convert on the day at 9pm EDT at a much faster rate!

"**CAVEAT EMPTOR.**

For those of you that do not already know:

Coinbase is going to be filing for a public IPO Offering within the next 2 weeks. Analysts that study Crypto-Chain stock indicate that Coinbase is expected to have a market Evaluation of roughly $70,000,000,000.00 USD. To put this into perspective, this would make coinbase worth more than companies like:

* Procter &amp; Gamble
* The Walt Disney Corporation
* FedEx
* MetLife Insurance
* PepsiCo

This evaluation puts Coinbase at Expected 47th spot on the Fortune 500 Companies List. Shares for Coinbase are currently expected to be Trading at roughly \~**200.00 USD** Per Share Minimum. Keep in mind, 1 Stock of Microsoft (MSFT) is currently trading as of this post on April 4th, 2021 at **$242.35 USD**. Coinbase has the potential to have stock that is worth more than a large number of Fortune 500 Stocks.

So what does this mean for Dogecoin? Well, as Coinabse offers it's IPO, all Crypto will see a dramatic increase in value. For dogecoin, **THIS WILL** be the time that dogecoin spikes above the **$0.11 USD** Mark, with Dogecoin possibly getting as high as **$0.15 USD**, with an expected new floor of around **$0.125 USD**. Time will show if Dogecoin keeps it's value or if it drops below expected floors. It depends on how perceptive the market is to purchasing the stock offerings from Coinbase. There will be an initial price surge in doge following the IPO release date though, that will definitively see Dogecoin go over **$0.11 USD**.

So how do we get these numbers? Well $0.15 USD is roughly 2.5x, on average, the current price of Dogecoin. Because of the immense value of Coinbase and their IPO, It would be asinine to not assume that doge will at least double it's current market value. Keep in mind that these numbers are EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE, and doge could possibly spike significantly higher. To be fair, I do not feel that this will be the trigger that gets doge over $1.00 USD, as I am not an expert in calculating futures and want to be generally conservative with floor and ceiling estimates. My associates degree is in software development not financial securities trading.

What will be really telling, is the number of hedge funds that pick up Coinbase as a stock option. If companies like **J.P Morgan-Chase** or **Fidelity Investments** purchase stock options in Coinbase for use in their Investment Hedge Funds, it will greatly normalize the use of Crypto Stock as an investment medium, which in turn , validates crypto currency as an investment medium. We will greatly benefit if major investment firms  start utilizing Coinbase IPO stock offerings for investment purposes.

Long story short, the time is now to buy additional Dogecoin, if possible. Past the IPO launch date, it may become impossible to purchase Doge for less than $0.10 USD.  OF course, only invest what you can and what you think is feasible for you.

What we need to look out for is Pump-And-Dump, or Inverse Ladder Attacks, epecially during the days preceding and the few days after the Coinbase IPO. People or investment firms with substantial standing may attempt to make Dogecoin surge because of it's currently low value. This could take dogecoin sky high, but then make it crash by conducting mass selloffs, then re-buying in with profit. This type of artificial options gaining is unnatural and will  only make dogecoin plummet. The idea here would be to attempt to invalidate Coinbase and it's IPO by making Crypto appear to be much more volatile than it is (That isn't to say that crypto isn't volatile in it's own ways, but this would be considered extremely artificially volatile). There are a lot of investment firms and people with substantial FIAT value that are afraid of decentralized currency and I would honestly not be surprised if something of this nature didn't happen or at least attempt to happen in the future. This would be the absolute worst case scenario, which I honestly don't see happening. If something of this nature were to happen, it would probably be done with a coin that has a moderately high value, like Litecoin or Ripple.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Buy additional Doge now if possible as the Coinbase IPO on April 14th, 2021 may make doge impossible to be purchased for under $0.10 USD, And please be wary of additional Pump-and-Dump tactics in the upcoming weeks. #DOGETOTHEMOON #HODL",The Coinbase IPO Offering and what it means for doge,2021,0

"Hello friends,

Welcome to our family. We are so happy to have you. Many OGs in here have been in since Doge was below a cent, some have been in here since the days it was below half a cent. 

We‚Äôve watched our gains turn to losses. We held. We‚Äôve watched people spend countless hours trying to prove that doge is a fruitless investment. We held. We were told it was just a fluke when it hit 7 cent. WE HELD!

Nobody could‚Äôve predicted in 2010 that Bitcoin would achieve the price is maintains today.

The leading experts in the financial sector denied the plausibility of Bitcoin swaying the economy for years.

Of course we‚Äôre going to see similar sentiments from the crypto ‚Äú experts ‚Äú, but just like their incorrect predecessors, they can‚Äôt see the future.

Now two of the most successful businessmen in the world are supporting Dogecoin. Even if they joke about it, their is no denying how meaningful this is.

Elon wants whales to sell in order for Doge to grow... what did we get for Doge Day? ONE OF THE BIGGEST WHALES SELLING! This whale has dumped 70 MILLION USD worth of Doge, and we STILL are above .20c. 

I‚Äôve been down 50% on my position in the past year. Now I‚Äôm 7,190% today. Just HODL. We are coming for you .40 friends. After that we will be welcoming our new .69 friends. 

By no means am I peddling some non-sense that Doge is gonna hit $69 this year. We blew away expectations by reaching above .10c, we should be grateful. Months ago most experts projected Doge would reach .08 by the end of 2021. Everything is going according to plan. Stay calm. Laugh at memes. 

If you‚Äôre in at  ~.40c just put the phone down and check back in a couple weeks. We went sideways for months, if we keep this level and momentum I‚Äôd think we‚Äôre due for $1 EASY by the end of the year.

"I just wanted to clarify one thing, since a lot of BS is being shoveled with respect to DOGE being inflationary. The idea that 10,000 DOGE are mined every minute, giving 14,400,000 new DOGE every day is accurate, but is only an issue IF the miners sell. Simply speaking, the way this works is that 'miners' are given an allocation of DOGE as a reward for 'mining' DOGE. But, this does not necessarily mean that the miner has to immediately sell the DOGE, as they can hold on to it, and 'bank' the DOGE into their wallets. Now this is the important part...

As long as there is greater demand for DOGE, than new coins mined, the price will keep going up... Also, the miners who are allocated the DOGE, would have to sell at market price to drive the price down, ***which is not in their best interest***. Think about it, if you were mining DOGE, are you going to sell at market once you get your allocation, and then drive down the price, so the coins you mine in the future are worth less???, or are you going to 'bank' the DOGE, so the price keeps going up, making you even more money??? Then, during price spikes, you sell a portion of your DOGE to fund the mining, and hodl the rest, so the price is not adversely affected. If the miners drive down the price, by immediately selling their DOGE once they get it, the price will fall, and then they will make less money in the future... This is what happens with BTC, the bitcoin miners don't immediately sell once they mine BTC, no, the bank the BTC, until a price spike and then sell for a profit, but not so much as to drive down the price too much, as this would cause the value of future BTC mined, to be less.

People want to make more money from crypto, not less, so the miners are not going to drive down the price, so their future mining is less profitable? No, they are going to HODL, to make more money, then sell a little for profit to fund their mining, then repeat....

tl:dr Even though the number is DOGE is going up each day, it is in the best interest of the miners to HODL, and accumulate DOGE/wealth, allowing the price to rise, rather than sell quickly and drive down the price in the future, and make less money mining down the road. 

This is why acceptance of DOGE as an everyday currency is so important! Let's assume a day when Amazon accepts DOGE. For the miners, this is a huge win, as rather than selling DOGE at market and driving down the price, they can buy actual merchandise with DOGE, and have less an effect on the price of DOGE, but get real world value for mining. Miners want the price of DOGE to go up, not down...","'Inflationary' DOGE supply, doesn't necessarily mean the price will go down",2021,0

"After the news of Coinbase Pro allowing the transfer of Dogecoin into their platform and effectively allowing trade and selling today, June 3rd, there have been a lot of media publications pushing against this. 

My favorite coming from the most-one-sided-joke-of-a-publication (and clearly backed by the elites) 
The Motley fool.

The Motley fool - ‚ÄúDump Dogecoin‚Äù these stocks are going to moon.

The Motley fool - ‚ÄúBattle of the 54 billion assets: Buy this, not Dogecoin.‚Äù

I mean why would anyone be against a simple, ‚ÄúJoke‚Äù crypto currency? We bother no one, we constantly correct undesirable behavior from our own community and we strive to do only good everyday...

So then why the FUD?

Because they know we‚Äôre right. 

We have been here way before the media attention and we‚Äôve stayed strong throughout the many storms. 

We finally reach one important milestone and we have become a threat to those on top. 

Clearly, everyday people should not be wealthy..

You‚Äôre blue collar job should be more than enough..

You don‚Äôt have a retirement account or a 401k? Ahh, don‚Äôt worry invest in the market where we may or may not loose your money. üôÉ I mean, you can always count on social security...üòí

Heck, if you‚Äôre getting by with minimum wage, working at a fast food restaurant, why are you complaining? 

Our community is growing strong and is only getting stronger by the day. 

This is only one out of many catalysts and I will continue to HODL, buy and buy. 

I don‚Äôt care what that means to anyone, CNBC, CNN, The Motley Fool, other subreddits.. Don‚Äôt worry about where I put my own money. We live very different lives and I accept responsibility for my own financial decisions. 

No matter how rich I get I will never become you. 

We are at the front lines! - Good luck to everyone today.

"Let's think big. A lot of people will sell at $1 (that's cool, I'll buy them) and even more will sell at $100.

But if a lot of us wait until $333, which will happen down the line where the Doge-Lords decide on market caps and acheive maximum tech... Those of us with 3000 coins or more will be gods.

So i want to start a club. The $333 club. Maybe someone will help me start this club. But now is the time to join. This COIN is going to rock. It will take time.. but patience is what makes BIG PLAYERS out of small players.

"Imagine being in the ocean and trying to swim ashore, but as much as you try you are still in the same spot after a while. That is Doge‚Äôs current situation.  Doge has the potential to be the next big thing or for a lack of better terms the one coin that can completely revolutionize cryptocurrency. For starters, Doge has one of the most unique communities in terms of activity and size. I‚Äôm guessing that many of us come from different backgrounds and have different professional experiences. The one thing that unites us is our love for Doge.  However, our community needs to take time and analyze the future of Doge. Doge has hit a plateau, which demands immediate attention.  By  taking a closer look at the numbers we can see that Doge lives in a constant Yo-yo like environment. It goes up a bit and then it corrects itself, never reaching or advancing past its projections. There‚Äôs no reason for Doge not to have reached the top 10 or at least be worth more than coins like Ripple. 

IF WE  DON‚ÄôT TAKE ACTION THE FUTURE IS BLEAK.  We need to define what we want to do with Doge. Do we want a coin that can be potentially life changing for many of us or do we want to keep the status quo where our coin  is seen more like a Meme than anything else.  It is important to mention that Doge lacks leadership. We lack a figure head that can provide the necessary vision or guidance to help the coin take the next step.  We are facing an immediate financial crisis after the Coronavirus Pandemic ends. That means that most people will look for ways to safeguard their assets. Bitcoin is a great coin but it lacks a committed community like ours or the simplicity that Doge provides.  Also, I‚Äôm sure we have people here that are suffering financially and any jump in price will help them. 

MY PROPOSAL: I‚Äôm proposing to create the Doge Coin Collective: this collective will look for ways to make Doge coin more mainstream and also for ways to make it more valuable. The second step should be to explore capping Doge coin at least temporarily, this will certainly give us an opportunity to create more valuation and a more centralized approach where we pause and explore better ways to utilize Doge. The cap should be temporary. The Elon Musk effect: Doge has the support of arguably one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history. We should be capitalizing on his endorsement.  We should explore the possibility of creating some buzz about Dogecoin using celebrities or influencers. New Dogecoin Market Exchange: Binance, Coinbase or Robinhood haven‚Äôt done much to make exchanging Doge easier or more accessible to the amateur trader. Therefore we should explore creating a Doge Market Exchange where trading is easier and where people have more access to the coin. In addition we should redefine how the coin is utilized. Take for example, the current situation where sadly people don‚Äôt have access to some of the most basic items. If we had a market where you could exchange Doge for goods or services then it would‚Äôve made life easier for many of us here.  

TO FINALIZE: There‚Äôs no doubt that Doge coin is very special and have the potential to have a meaningful impact in our daily lives. However if we don‚Äôt take immediate action it‚Äôs future is bleak at best. I predict that we‚Äôll lose roughly 25-40% of our community within the next 12-24 months given the unpredictability of the current economy. If we enter a recession people will start panicking and will start selling their coins. The would be devastating for Doge.  The good news is that we have time and the human capital to take necessary action in order to preserve the future of our beloved coin.

"Hey there everyone, so I've had dogecoin for a while now and I like it, mostly because of the meme lol. Anyways, since I'm relatively new to cryptocurrency, especially dogecoin, I'm curious if 75K thousand people bought say $5 worth of dogecoin on a single day and or time, would it increase the price of dogecoin? I remember reading in a GTA V stock market post that players came together to try to increase the price of a stock (not sure how accurate this is) and it didn't work. Would this work in real life with Dogecoin? Anyways, sorry for being a noob, but I would like to know, thank you!","If half of this subreddit bought say $5 worth of Dogecoin, would it increase the price?",2020,0

"Hi. Im thinking about talking to my parents about inveating in dogecoin, and i was going to see if it would be worth it in the long run. What i hope is that by investing now, when the time comes to go to colleg, i can use dogecoin. 

In reality, i just need a good argument to use with my parents, to sway them into letting me do it. This is very important to me, as I worry daily what ill do when i have to leave the house and become an adult. Every day it gets closer and closer. Does anyone have anything that could help me sway my peeps? It would be really helpful. Should i invest? Or nu.

Edit: HOLY- WTH that was the fastest response ive ever gotten(i had a old profile for roughly 2 years. Yeah i deleted it) This is wow. Also, shoutout to u/adevrye for making zero cents.

Edit 2: ok. So. All of yall have brought up great points, and im rethinking 50-100, maybe 10-15 to begin with. And maybe investing in a more stable-ish cryptocurrency. Yall awesome.

"Imagine being in the ocean and trying to swim ashore, but as much as you try you are still in the same spot after a while. That is Doge‚Äôs current situation.  Doge has the potential to be the next big thing or for a lack of better terms the one coin that can completely revolutionize cryptocurrency. For starters, Doge has one of the most unique communities in terms of activity and size. I‚Äôm guessing that many of us come from different backgrounds and have different professional experiences. The one thing that unites us is our love for Doge.  However, our community needs to take time and analyze the future of Doge. Doge has hit a plateau, which demands immediate attention.  By  taking a closer look at the numbers we can see that Doge lives in a constant Yo-yo like environment. It goes up a bit and then it corrects itself, never reaching or advancing past its projections. There‚Äôs no reason for Doge not to have reached the top 10 or at least be worth more than coins like Ripple. 

IF WE  DON‚ÄôT TAKE ACTION THE FUTURE IS BLEAK.  We need to define what we want to do with Doge. Do we want a coin that can be potentially life changing for many of us or do we want to keep the status quo where our coin  is seen more like a Meme than anything else.  It is important to mention that Doge lacks leadership. We lack a figure head that can provide the necessary vision or guidance to help the coin take the next step.  We are facing an immediate financial crisis after the Coronavirus Pandemic ends. That means that most people will look for ways to safeguard their assets. Bitcoin is a great coin but it lacks a committed community like ours or the simplicity that Doge provides.  Also, I‚Äôm sure we have people here that are suffering financially and any jump in price will help them. 

MY PROPOSAL: I‚Äôm proposing to create the Doge Coin Collective: this collective will look for ways to make Doge coin more mainstream and also for ways to make it more valuable. The second step should be to explore capping Doge coin at least temporarily, this will certainly give us an opportunity to create more valuation and a more centralized approach where we pause and explore better ways to utilize Doge. The cap should be temporary. The Elon Musk effect: Doge has the support of arguably one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history. We should be capitalizing on his endorsement.  We should explore the possibility of creating some buzz about Dogecoin using celebrities or influencers. New Dogecoin Market Exchange: Binance, Coinbase or Robinhood haven‚Äôt done much to make exchanging Doge easier or more accessible to the amateur trader. Therefore we should explore creating a Doge Market Exchange where trading is easier and where people have more access to the coin. In addition we should redefine how the coin is utilized. Take for example, the current situation where sadly people don‚Äôt have access to some of the most basic items. If we had a market where you could exchange Doge for goods or services then it would‚Äôve made life easier for many of us here.  

TO FINALIZE: There‚Äôs no doubt that Doge coin is very special and have the potential to have a meaningful impact in our daily lives. However if we don‚Äôt take immediate action it‚Äôs future is bleak at best. I predict that we‚Äôll lose roughly 25-40% of our community within the next 12-24 months given the unpredictability of the current economy. If we enter a recession people will start panicking and will start selling their coins. The would be devastating for Doge.  The good news is that we have time and the human capital to take necessary action in order to preserve the future of our beloved coin. Remember this is mere a suggestion and I would love you get meaningful feedback.",The Future of Doge Coin,2020,0

"Hey there everyone, so I've had dogecoin for a while now and I like it, mostly because of the meme lol. Anyways, since I'm relatively new to cryptocurrency, especially dogecoin, I'm curious if 75K thousand people bought say $5 worth of dogecoin on a single day and or time, would it increase the price of dogecoin? I remember reading in a GTA V stock market post that players came together to try to increase the price of a stock (not sure how accurate this is) and it didn't work. Would this work in real life with Dogecoin? Anyways, sorry for being a noob, but I would like to know, thank you!","If half of this subreddit bought say $5 worth of Dogecoin, would it increase the price?",2020,0

"Hi. Im thinking about talking to my parents about inveating in dogecoin, and i was going to see if it would be worth it in the long run. What i hope is that by investing now, when the time comes to go to colleg, i can use dogecoin. 

In reality, i just need a good argument to use with my parents, to sway them into letting me do it. This is very important to me, as I worry daily what ill do when i have to leave the house and become an adult. Every day it gets closer and closer. Does anyone have anything that could help me sway my peeps? It would be really helpful. Should i invest? Or nu.

Edit: HOLY- WTH that was the fastest response ive ever gotten(i had a old profile for roughly 2 years. Yeah i deleted it) This is wow. Also, shoutout to u/adevrye for making zero cents.

Edit 2: ok. So. All of yall have brought up great points, and im rethinking 50-100, maybe 10-15 to begin with. And maybe investing in a more stable-ish cryptocurrency. Yall awesome.

"I feel like dogecoin with its unlimited supply and fast transactions and whatnot could easily be used as an in game currency. To me that totally aligns with dogecoin (not trying to be taken too seriously)

Heres the concept:
Text based multiplayer online game with in game currency AND dogecoins for 'premium items'. There would be some sort of exchange rate that goes both ways as well.
The setting is yet to be worked out but I imagine some form of Doge kingdom, quests, jobs, casino, jail, shops, lottery tickets etc etc. People could play it safe and work/gamble, or take bigger risks by doing quests and crimes. 
Probably some sort of faucet in the casino.
I like the idea of guilds or tribes or something of the sorts but it would also be possible to play alone. 

Since I started on the Dogepuzzles I've just felt like Dogecoin should have a bigger place in fun and games and wondered if theres any actual interest for something like this?

So I'm Hodling Doge... I love how well the creators made the interface, although from what I've heard, the creators originally made the coin as a Joke and had no real plans for it...  


Has anything changed since then? If Dogecoin was trying to offer a service more people would invest...

"Hey all, GoodShibe here.

Just wanted to throw a quick heads up and some best practices out there for people who are looking to buy and sell Dogecoin directly.

Please, please, please before you do any buying or selling go have a good look at /r/DogecoinScamWatch. Look at all the cases of people who either didn't know or knew better but didn't follow proper safety protocols. Speaking as someone who has, themselves, been scammed in the past it was my need to 'rush' things that screwed me over. And I definitely know better, lol. 

So, if you're looking to buy/sell Dogecoin directly, please keep this most important piece of advice in mind:

Go slow. Dogecoin moves fast do you don't have to. If you're selling $100 in Doge, do it in 20 x $5 transactions. Get payment, send DOGE, or vice versa. The person initiating the trade goes first. For instance: if you make an open post about wanting to buy/sell, the person who responds is initiating the trade, they go first. If you approach someone directly about wanting to trade with them, you're the initiator, you go first.

One of the most common ways a user gets scammed here is that they say they're suddenly in a rush or have to go, they'll often ask you if you can just send a couple big trades instead. Guess what usually happens next? Again, go look at /r/DogecoinScamWatch and you'll see this and more.

Once your DOGE is sent it is no longer yours and cannot be recovered. A modicum of patience and research will save you a lot of heartache.

To find out more about common scams and how to avoid them, please check out our Wiki:

After what most people do not know was a very short vague conversation it was decided that developmentally Dogecoin would be left in the hands of a group of developers.

It's been some time since we last spoke. I've been busy making games in virtual reality lately, but you might remember me from the [DogecoinOnTheMoon](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3faxct/dogecoinonthemoon_its_time_im_calling_out_the_big/) effort! We raised funds to send a physical representation of a Dogecoin to the moon with the help of Astrobotic. 

Astrobotic has pushed back the launch date multiple times which has been a little disappointing. I remember when it was supposed to happen this year! Well, I recently spoke with a member of the [Astrobotic](https://www.astrobotic.com/moon-box) team and found that their current launch window is Q1 of 2021.

"  

One doge = one doge

Mathematically correct and no way it‚Äôs an example of circular reasoning, rather it‚Äôs a truism. But here is my take on it.

Let‚Äôs take a look at stocks per for example. You can have long positions, short positions and there is day trading. Doge people (here at least) would mostly be people with long positions, they are in for the long run, and/or just USE doges. No trading at all, or trading every once in a while to try to add to their position.

Now, the point is (and that is another truism), there are no gains or losses IF YOU DON‚ÄôT SELL. You need to sell to have a profit or loss and as long as you do not sell you still have your stock/shares/doges! Let‚Äôs say you got 100 shares Amazon. You do not sell it, so you still have 100 shares Amazon whether the market price goes up or down or the company goes bankrupt. For whatever reason you just keep your shares: you just like the company, or the idea and want to keep supporting them, you hope it will be worth a lot more in the future or whatever. So, whatever the market does, you do not lose or gain until you actually sell!

I do not watch the tickers of the markets on doge every hour (other than just for fun or interest) and I‚Äôm not overly worried if it goes down a lot. I enjoy seeing it going up though (I have to admit it), but up or down: one doge keeps being one doge.",one doge,2019,0

Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency [which now has a market cap of over $300 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/), and at one point a market cap in excess of $2 billion, traces its origins back to a Japanese kindergarten teacher who posted pictures of her Shiba Inu in February 2010. There was one particular picture where the Shiba Inu was glaring sideways with raised eyebrows, and for some reason this picture has a similar allure as the Mona Lisa. The picture leaves it open for interpretation as to what the Shiba Inu is thinking, and people began plastering words all over the picture to indicate the dog‚Äôs thoughts.¬†[This meme was then nicknamed the doge](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge).

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/o5a3qeyoxmk31.png

By 2013 the doge had become a full fledged viral internet sensation, and this simultaneously coincided with the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies. In 2009 the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was released. Around 2013, and perhaps a little before then, people began to fork Bitcoin‚Äôs code and create all sorts of alternative cryptocurrencies.

Billy Markus, a programmer from Oregon, [decided to create a cryptocurrency that would be more fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin) and reach a wider audience than Bitcoin. Markus teamed up with Jackson Palmer, a marketer for Adobe Systems, and they made this new fun cryptocurrency a reality. They chose the doge meme as the basis for their cryptocurrency, since it was quite popular at the time, and also adopted the algorithm from Luckycoin, where the block rewards are random like a lottery, unlike the fixed Bitcoin block rewards. Luckycoin derived its code from Litecoin, which is the #1 Scrypt cryptocurrency, and Litecoin itself is a derivation of Bitcoin.

Also importantly, Dogecoin‚Äôs Scrypt algorithm made it so miners had a low barrier to entry. Bitcoin mining had already become so competitive that only people with specialized and expensive equipment could realistically mine Bitcoin, whereas Dogecoin could be successfully mined with a GPU or even a CPU on a regular computer. This means anyone interested could easily start mining Dogecoin without spending money on mining rigs.

Further, despite being based on a meme, Dogecoin is decentralized, which puts it ahead of most of the alternative cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin has no premine and no initial coin offering (ICO), meaning all Dogecoins in circulation were distributed via mining, and the market is less prone to centralized dumping. Dogecoin uses the proof of work (PoW) algorithm which ensures the network is decentralized as well, rather than more centralized options like proof of stake (PoS).

Dogecoin launched at the exact right time to ride the dual waves of the doge meme‚Äôs popularity and the popularity of new alternative cryptocurrencies, and less than two months after launch Dogecoin had become a major cryptocurrency with a market cap in excess of $60 million.

After that, Dogecoin continued to be quite popular for a couple of reasons. As originally intended, Dogecoin ended up being a fun cryptocurrency, and a community developed around Dogecoin, especially on the [Dogecoin subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin). People began to tip each other Dogecoin constantly, especially since there were on the order of 100 billion Dogecoins, as compared to a maximum supply of only 21 million Bitcoins. This means that someone could easily tip hundreds or thousands of Dogecoins since it is not very expensive, while it is simultaneously exciting.

The general Dogecoin culture of tipping and generosity attracted many new users who had never been involved with cryptocurrency before. Newbies would first start accumulating Dogecoin tips, and then within the community they would learn how to accumulate even more Dogecoin by mining, and this represented a launching point where such users could go on to dive into the rest of the crypto space.

That is the reason why Dogecoin is still a major cryptocurrency to this day and will likely be a major cryptocurrency for the foreseeable future. The Dogecoin community is welcoming, generous, fun, and insightful. Essentially, Dogecoin is an important portal for the crypto space.","Dogecoin: The Meme That Turned Into A Cryptocurrency With A $300 Million Market Cap, An Important Portal To The Crypto Space",2019,0

You might need to be the first supplier of Doge to your friends. You can sell them some for cash or just wait for an opportunity like settling a lunch bill. 

I'm telling you if we all did this -- there are like 400k members of this Reddit. Can you imagine the adoption? 

If each of us only found one friend to do this deal with it would be awesome. Of course... Some won't be interested. But your friends who aren't cash strapped will think it's kinda cool to own a crypto currency... And because Doge is so cheap they'll get a couple thousand or more when you need to pay them for dinner. 

Just show them the pic of Doge... Tell them how it's one of the oldest surviving Cryptos with the most loyal community....

So I went and made a backup of my wallet.dat - the file size is massive though something around two gigs. and now when I tried to reinstall everything and put my back up back in, it won't sync or recognize the dat file.   


Here are some interesting facts though. Which has me very puzzled.  when I checked my blockchain for my wallet there was a period of 6 months where a shit load of transaction took place, small amounts going to about 10 different wallets, that a) I wasn't sending coin or even buying coins at that period of time. b) I am just very confused at these amounts.   


I am losing my mind here at what the hell is going on.",Help! My Wallet is messed up,2019,0
"Hey shibes,

Over the weekend Jackson Palmer has been talking to myself, Sporklin, Max and Michi about what to do with the dogecoin.com domain. After much discussion he's entrusted the domain to myself as the most visible developer, and that transfer happened earlier today. He's also relinquished access to the Twitter account.

What does that mean for you? Right now, not a lot - we have better continuity planning in place as /u/langer_hans now has some access to both the domain and Twitter account, at least. Email is being set up so we can be contacted via the domain, but mostly all of this is a work in progress.

Long term we're looking at creating a non-profit simply to hold these accounts - it's unlikely to be an active entity in the way the foundation was, but merely a legal entity that allows us to have better ownership of shared items.

I know you're going to have questions - right now, this is all we know. I've just switched PCs and need to reinstall Gitian then ship 1.14.1, and Max is away for a short break, hopefully we'll be back with more news after that.

Meanwhile, stay wow everyone!

"I just sold all my doge to make sure i'll make it through the month.
I've made some financial mistakes in the past, ending up with about 15k eu of debt. Nearly paid it all off, but the savings finally have run out and left me with no choice but to sell my 120k doge.

I've always loved this community, and if I ever have the money to buy back, I definitely will.

But for now, I'll just be a bystander, wishing doge the best of luck.",So long friends.,2019,0

"ive been reading on crypto currency since like 2009 but ive never actually paid too much attention since i was a youngster then now im of the age to where i can start utilizing this thing called life, and i want doge to be apart of it.  
ive always known that crypto was going to take off but since ive been off the grid for a few years i never got to see how entirely, now that the forums of the planet are residing here on reddit and most websites like to give a small insight onto this massive world that we have today. i turn to you, the community to help me find the path to the paw.   


  
so i have dogecoin core on my computer, i understand it takes a few days for it to sync up and be ready for use. but in the meantime id like to get prepared to slowly etch some doge off the block train.   
what programs would one suggest to run scrypt in a fun friendly manner that helps one learn the way into this new realm.   
i have guiminer and easyminer, but what should i be doing, would my daily earn be more beneficial if i figured out how to mine on my pc and if when i do solo mine or shall i join a pool with all you fellow doge's",im new here,2019,0

"Let me know if this breaks any rules: I was hoping shibes might be interested in taking a survey for science in exchange for Doge. (If not, just let me know and I‚Äôll nuke the thread.)

If so, how does 100 Doge per completed survey sound? I‚Äôm open to suggestions‚ÄîI just figured 100 is a nice round number and 100 Doge = 100 Doge

Plus, you get to be entered into a drawing for 1 of 3 prizes: $100, $50, or $20 USD worth of Doge (or an Amazon gift card, if you prefer that for some reason). You‚Äôll just need to enter your Doge wallet address and I will send the Doge after you complete the survey (it‚Äôs not automatic but I‚Äôll be sending the Doge regularly).

You can [take the survey here](https://survey.volitionlab.com/zs/GsBUd1?ref=rdoge).

The purpose of this study is to validate a new personality assessment. It is a survey that should take about 15-20 minutes to complete. It¬†consists of one short-answer question and a series of single-word answer, multiple choice, and rating questions about facial expression,¬†your personality, behaviour, mood, and your choices to hypothetical scenarios.¬†You also have the option to include demographic information about yourself. Your answers are anonymous and will only be associated with a generated code‚Äîyour name will not be associated with your answers.

By participating you will have the option to be entered in a drawing for one of three prizes (your choice of Dogecoin or an Amazon gift card worth $50, $30, or $20 USD). To be included in the drawing, you will need to provide your email address at the end of this survey. This is optional to participating in this study, and your name and email will not be associated with your responses or the generated code.

You will also be given the option to consent to potentially being contacted for follow up research by submitting your email address. This *will* associate your results with your email address but is strictly optional.

If you're interested, you can [follow this link to start the survey](https://survey.volitionlab.com/zs/GsBUd1?ref=rdoge).
